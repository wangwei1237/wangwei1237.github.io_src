engineering. If you need to “break” your app, this book will have a tool that will help you with that.\nAlessandro Campeis\n\nAuto engineers test the safety of a car by intentionally crashing it and carefully observing the results. Chaos engineering applies the same principles to software systems. In Chaos Engineering: Site reliability through controlled disruption, you’ll learn to run your applications and infrastructure through a series of tests that simulate real-life failures. You’ll maximize the benefits of chaos engineering by learning to think like a chaos engineer, and how to design the proper experiments to ensure the reliability of your software. With examples that cover a whole spectrum of software, you’ll be ready to run an intensive testing regime on anything from a simple WordPress site to a massive distributed system running on Kubernetes.\nabout the technology\nRather than just looking for code bugs and errors, chaos engineering sees how your software responds to calamity, including partial infrastructure outages, hardware failure, and other major pitfalls that can befall a production system. By observing a system in distress or under attack, chaos engineering ensures the reliability and resiliency of your software—especially for hard-to-test distributed systems with lots of moving parts and little scope for downtime.\nabout the book\nIn Chaos Engineering: Site reliability through controlled disruption you’ll learn to design and execute controlled failure experiments that reveal the hidden problems in your software. Using a toolbox of open source tools, you’ll inject system-shaking failures at every level—from your Docker containers, to your Kubernetes deployment, to the UI. You’ll learn Linux monitoring for observing system metrics and evaluating your results, and even how to apply Chaos Engineering to make your human teams more reliable and resilient to handling failures. Best of all, all tools and examples come with a downloadable Linux VM image, letting you easily experiment without risk to your own systems.\nwhat's inside\nDesign, run and analyze Chaos Engineering experiments\nSee how applications react to a database connections latency\nExperiment with Docker container isolation\nTest software running on Kubernetes and the platform itself\nInject failure into software running in the HVM\nabout the reader\nFor developers with basic knowledge of scripting and Linux.\nabout the author\nMikolaj Pawlikowski has been practicing chaos engineering for four years, beginning with a large distributed Kubernetes-based microservices platform at Bloomberg.

For anyone working in software engineering, it would have been really hard to not hear it mentioned at the very least. I personally had never seen an open-source project become so popular so quickly. I remember going to one of the first editions of KubeCon in London in 2016 to try to evaluate whether it was worth investing any time into this entire Kubernetes thing. Fast forward to 2020, and Kubernetes expertise is now one of the most demanded skills!\nKubernetes solves (or at least makes it easier to solve) a lot of problems that arise when running software across a fleet of machines. Its wide adoption indicates that it might be doing something right. But, like everything else, it’s not perfect and it adds its own complexity to the system--complexity that needs to be managed and understood, and one that lends well to the practices of chaos engineering.\nKubernetes is a big topic, so we’ll split it into three chapters:\n\nThis chapter: Chaos in Kubernetes\nQuick introduction to Kubernetes, where it came from and what it does.\nSetting up a test Kubernetes cluster. We’ll cover getting a mini cluster up and running because there is nothing like working on the real thing. If you have your own clusters you want to use, that’s perfectly fine too.\nTesting a real project’s resilience to failure. We’ll first apply chaos engineering to the application itself, to see how it copes with the basic types of failure we expect it to handle. We’ll set things up manually.\n\n\nChapter 11: Automating Kubernetes experiments\nIntroducing a high-level tool for chaos engineering on Kubernetes.\nUsing that tool to re-implement the experiments we set up manually in chapter 10 to teach you how to do it more easily.\nDesigning experiments for an ongoing verification of SLOs. We’ll see how to set things up to automatically detect problems on live systems, for example when an SLO is breached.\nDesigning experiments for the cloud layer. We’ll see how we can leverage cloud APIs to test how systems behave when machines go down.\n\n\nChapter 12: Under the hood of Kubernetes\nUnderstanding how Kubernetes itself works, and how to break it. This is where we dig deeper, and we test the actual Kubernetes components. We’ll cover the anatomy of a Kubernetes cluster and discuss various ideas for chaos experiments to verify our assumptions about how it handles failure.\n\n\n\nMy goal with these three chapters is to take you from a basic understanding of what Kubernetes is and how it works, all the way to knowing how things tick under the hood, and where the fragile points are and how chaos engineering can help with understanding and managing the way the system handles failure.\nThis is pretty exciting stuff, and I can’t wait to show you around! Like every good journey, let’s start ours with a story.\n"},"docs/Porting_things_onto_Kubernetes.html":{"url":"docs/Porting_things_onto_Kubernetes.html","title":"10.1 Porting things onto Kubernetes","keywords":"","body":"10.1 Porting things onto Kubernetes\n“It’s technically a promotion, and Kubernetes is really hot right now, so that’s going to be great for your career! So you’re in, right?” said Alice as she walked out of the room. As the door closed, it finally hit you, that even though what she said was phrased as a question, in her mind, there wasn’t much uncertainty about the outcome: You must save that High-Profile Project, period.\nThe project was weird from the beginning. The upper management announced it to a lot of fanfare and red-ribbon-cutting, but it was never made quite clear what function it was supposed to serve.--apart from “solving a lot of problems” by doing things like “getting rid of the monolith” and leveraging “the power of microservices” and the “amazing features of Kubernetes.” And - as if this wasn’t mysterious enough - the previous technical lead of the team just left the company. He really left. The last time someone was in contact with him, he was on his way to the Himalayas to start a new life as a llama breeder.\nTruth be told, you are the person for this job. People know you’re into chaos engineering, and they heard about the problems you uncovered with your experiments. If anyone can pick up where the llama-breeder-to-be left off and turn it into a reliable system, it’s you! You just need to learn how this entire Kubernetes thing works, what the High-Profile project is supposed to do, and then come up with a plan of attack. Lucky for you, this chapter will teach you exactly that. What a coincidence! Also, the documentation you inherited reveals some useful details. Let’s take a look at it.\n10.1.1 High-profile project documentation\nThere isn’t much documentation for the High-Profile Project, so I’ll just paste it verbatim for you to get the full experience. Turns out that, rather suitably, the project is called ICANT. Here’s how the document describes this acronym:\nICANT - International, Crypto-fueled, AI-powered, Next-generation market Tracking\nA little cryptic, isn’t it? It’s almost like someone designed it to be confusing to raise more funds. Something to do with AI and cryptocurrencies. But wait, there is a mission statement too, maybe this clears things up a little bit:\nBuild a massively-scalable, distributed system for tracking cryptocurrency flows with cutting-edge AI for technologically advanced clients all over the world.\n\nNo, not really; that doesn’t help much. Fortunately there is more. The section on current status reveals that we don’t need to worry about the AI, crypto or market stuff - that’s all on the TODO list. This is what it says:\nCurrent status: first we approached the “distributed” part. We’re running Kubernetes, so we set up Goldpinger that makes connections between all the nodes to simulate the crypto traffic.\nTODO: the AI stuff, the crypto stuff and markets stuff\n\nAll of a sudden, starting a new life in the Himalayas makes much more sense! They took a network diagnostic tool Goldpinger (https://github.com/bloomberg/goldpinger - by yours truly), deployed it on their Kubernetes cluster, put all the actual work in the TODO, and left the company. And now it’s your problem!\nWhat does Goldpinger actually do? It produces a full graph of Kubertnetes cluster connectivity by calling all instances of itself, measuring the times and producing reports based on that data. Typically one runs an instance of Goldpinger per node in their cluster to detect any networking issues across nodes. See figure 10.1 for an example of what a graph like that looks like with a single node having connectivity issues. The Goldpinger UI uses colors (green for OK, red for trouble), and I marked the affected link in the screenshot.\nFigure 10.1 Goldpinger graph showing connectivity between nodes in a Kubernetes cluster\n\nFor any crypto-AI-market-tracking enthusiast this is going to be an anti-climax. But from our point of view, it makes the job easier: we have a single component to work with that doesn’t require any buzzwords knowledge. We can do it. First stop - a quick intro to Kubernetes. Start your stopwatch.\n"},"docs/Whats_Kubernetes_in_7_minutes.html":{"url":"docs/Whats_Kubernetes_in_7_minutes.html","title":"10.2 What’s Kubernetes (in 7 minutes)","keywords":"","body":"10.2 What’s Kubernetes (in 7 minutes)?\nKubernetes (often referred to as k8s for short) describes itself as “an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications” (https://kubernetes.io/). That sounds great, but what does that really mean?\nLet’s start simple. Let’s say you have a piece of software that you need to run on your computer. You can start your laptop, log in, and run the program. Congratulations, you just did a manual deployment of your software! So far so good.\nNow, imagine that you need the same piece of software to run not on 1, but on 10 computers. All of a sudden, logging into 10 computers doesn’t sound so attractive, so you begin to think about automating that deployment. You could hack together a script that uses SSH to remotely log into the 10 computers and start your program. Or you could use one of the many existing configuration management tools, like Ansible (https://github.com/ansible/ansible) or Chef (https://www.chef.io/). With 10 computers to take care of, it might just work.\nUnfortunately, it turns out that the program you started on these machines sometimes crashes. It might not even be a bug, but other problems, for example insufficient disk storage. So you need something to supervise the process, and try to bring it back up when it crashes. You could achieve that by making your configuration management tool configure a systemd service (https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html) so that the process gets restarted automatically every time it dies.\nThe software also needs to be upgraded. Every time you want to deploy a new version, you need to rerun your configuration management solution to stop and uninstall the previous version, and then install and start the new one. Also, the new version has different dependencies, so you need to take care of that too, during the update. Oh, and now your cluster contains 200 machines, because other people like your program, and then want you to run their software too (no need to reinvent the wheel for each piece of software we want to deploy, right?), so it’s beginning to take a long time to roll a new version out.\nEvery machine has limited resources (CPU, RAM, disk space), so you now have this massive spreadsheet to keep track of what software should run on which machine, so that they don’t run out of resources. When you onboard a new project, you allocate resources to it, and mark where it should run in the spreadsheet. And when one of the machines goes down, you look for some available room elsewhere, and migrate the software from the affected machine onto another one. It’s hard work, but people keep coming, so you must be doing something right!\nWouldn’t it be great, if there was a program that can do all this for you? Well, yes, you guessed it, it’s called Kubernetes; it does all this and more. Where did it come from?\n10.2.1 The very brief history of Kubernetes\nKubernetes, from a Greek word meaning “helmsman” or “governor,” is an open source project released by Google in 2015 as a reimplementation of their internal scheduler system called Borg (https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/). Google donated Kubernetes to a newly formed foundation called Cloud Native Computing Foundation (or CNCF for short https://www.cncf.io/), which created a neutral home for the project and encouraged a massive influx of investment from other companies.\nIt worked. In the short five years since the project creation, it has become a defacto API for scheduling containers. As companies adopted the open source project, Google managed to pull people away from investing more into AWS-specific solutions, and its cloud offering has gained more clout.\nAlong the way, the CNCF also gained many auxiliary projects that work with Kubernetes, like the monitoring system Prometheus (https://prometheus.io/), container runtime Containerd (https://containerd.io/) and figuratively tons more.\nIt all sounds great, but the real question that leads to a wide adoption is: what can it do for you? Let me show you.\n10.2.2 What can Kubernetes do for you?\nKubernetes works declaratively, rather than imperatively. What I mean by that is that it lets you describe the software you want to run on your cluster, and it continuously tries to converge the current cluster state into the one you requested. It also lets you read the current state at any given time. Conceptually, it’s an API for herding cats (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/herd_cats).\nTo use Kubernetes, you need a Kubernetes cluster. A Kubernetes cluster is a set of machines that run the Kubernetes components, and that make their resources (CPU, RAM, disk space) available to be allocated and used by your software. These machines are typically called worker nodes. A single Kubernetes cluster can have thousands of worker nodes.\nLet’s say that you have a cluster, and you want to run some new software on that cluster. There are three worker nodes in your cluster, each containing a certain amount of resources that are available. Imagine that one of your workers has a moderate amount of resources available, a second one has plenty available, and the third one is entirely used. Depending on the resources the new piece of software needs, your cluster might be able to run it on the first or the second but not the third worker node. Visually, it could look like figure 10.2. Note, that it’s possible (and sometimes pretty useful) to have heterogeneous nodes, with various configurations of resources available.\nFigure 10.2 Resources available in a small Kubernetes cluster\n\nWhat would starting new software on this cluster look like? All you need to do is tell your cluster what your software looks like (the container image to run, any configuration like environment variables of secrets), how much resources you want to give it (CPU, RAM, disk space), and how to run it (how many copies, any constraints on where it should run). You do that by making an HTTP request to the Kubernetes API (or using a tool, like the official CLI called kubectl). The part of the cluster that receives the request, stores it as the desired state, and immediately goes to work in the background on converging the current state of the cluster to the desired state is often referred to as the control plane. Let’s say that you want to deploy version v1.0 of mysoftware. You need to allocate 1 core and 1GB of RAM for each copy, and you need to run two copies for high availability. To make sure that one worker going down doesn’t take both copies down with it, you add a constraint that the two copies shouldn’t run on the same worker node. You send this request to the control plane, which stores it and returns OK. In the background, the same control plane calculates where to schedule the new software, finds two workers with enough available resources and notifies these workers to start your software. See figure 10.3 which shows this process visually.\nFigure 10.3 Interacting with a Kubernetes cluster\n\nAnd voila! That’s what Kubernetes can do for you. Instead of making your machines do specific, low-level tasks like starting a process, you can tell your cluster to figure out how to do what you need it to do. This is a 10,000-feet aerial view, but don’t worry, we’ll get into the nitty gritty later in the chapter. Right now, I bet you can’t wait for some hands-on experience. Let’s get to that by setting up a test cluster.\nNOTE POP QUIZ: WHAT’S KUBERNETES?\nPick one:\n\nA solution to all of your problems\nA software that automatically renders the system running on it immune to failure\nA container orchestrator that can managed thousands of VMs and will continuously try to converge the current state into the desired state\nA thing for sailors\n\nSee appendix B for answers.\n\n"},"docs/Setting_up_a_Kubernetes_cluster.html":{"url":"docs/Setting_up_a_Kubernetes_cluster.html","title":"10.3 Setting up a Kubernetes cluster","keywords":"","body":"10.3 Setting up a Kubernetes cluster\nBefore we can continue with our scenario, you’re going to need access to a working Kubernetes cluster. The beauty of Kubernetes, is that you can get the cluster from various providers, and it should behave exactly the same! All the examples in this chapter will work on any conformant clusters and I will mention where there might be potential caveats. Therefore you’re free to pick whatever installation of Kubernetes is the most convenient for you.\nFor those who don’t have a Kubernetes cluster handy, the easiest way to get started is to deploy a single-node, local mini-cluster on your local machine with Minikube (https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube). Minikube is an official part of Kubernetes itself, and allows you to deploy a single node with single instances of all the Kubernetes control plane components inside of a virtual machine. It also takes care of the little-yet-crucial things like helping you easily access things running inside of the cluster.\nBefore continuing, please follow Appendix A to install Minikube. In this chapter, I’ll assume you’re following along with a Minikube installation on your laptop. I’ll also mention whatever might be different if you’re not. Everything in this chapter was tested on Minikube 1.12.3, and Kubernetes 1.18.3.\n10.3.1 Starting a cluster\nDepending on the platform, Minikube supports multiple virtualization options to run the actual VM with Kubernetes. The options differ for each platform and include:\n\nLinux: KVM or VirtualBox (running processes directly on the host is also supported)\nmacOS: HyperKit, VMware Fusion, Parallels or VirtualBox\nWindows: Hyper-V or VirtualBox\n\nFor our purposes, you can pick any of the supported options and it should work all the same. But because I already made you install VirtualBox for the previous chapters and it’s a common denominator of all three supported platforms, I’d recommend we stick with VirtualBox.\nTo start a cluster, all you need is the minikube start command. To specify the VirtualBox driver, use the --driver flag. Run the following command from a terminal to start a new cluster using VirtualBox:\nminikube start --driver=virtualbox\n\nThe command might take a minute, because minikube needs to download the VM image for your cluster and then start a VM with that image. When it’s done, you will see the output similar to the following. Someone took the time to pick relevant emoticons for each log message, so I took the time to respect that and copy verbatim. You can see that it used the VirtualBox driver like I requested and defaulted to give the VM 2 CPUs, 4GB of RAM and 2GB of storage. It’s also running Kubernetes v1.18.3 on Docker 19.03.12 (all in bold font).\n😄  minikube v1.12.3 on Darwin 10.14.6 \n✨  Using the virtualbox driver based on user configuration \n👍  Starting control plane node minikube in cluster minikube \n🔥  Creating virtualbox VM (CPUs=2, Memory=4000MB, Disk=20000MB) … \n🐳  Preparing Kubernetes v1.18.3 on Docker 19.03.12 … \n🔎  Verifying Kubernetes components… \n🌟  Enabled addons: default-storageclass, storage-provisioner \n🏄  Done! kubectl is now configured to use \"minikube\"\n\nTo confirm that it started OK, try to list all pods running on the cluster. Run the following command in a terminal:\nkubectl get pods -A\n\nYou will see the output just like the following, listing the different components that together make the Kubernetes control plane. We will cover in detail how they work later in this chapter. For now, this command working at all proves that the control plane works.\nNAMESPACE     NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE \nkube-system   coredns-66bff467f8-62g9p           1/1     Running   0          5m44s \nkube-system   etcd-minikube         1/1     Running   0          5m49s \nkube-system   kube-apiserver-minikube            1/1     Running   0          5m49s \nkube-system   kube-controller-manager-minikube   1/1     Running   0          5m49s \nkube-system   kube-proxy-bwzcf      1/1     Running   0          5m44s \nkube-system   kube-scheduler-minikube            1/1     Running   0          5m49s \nkube-system   storage-provisioner                1/1     Running   0          5m49s\n\nWe’re now ready to go.

The pressure is on, we have a project to save!\nAs always, the first step is to build an understanding of how things work before we can reason about how they break. We’ll do that by kicking the tires and looking how ICANT is deployed and configured. Once we’re done with that, we’ll conduct two experiments and then finish this section by seeing how to make things easier for ourselves for the next time. Let’s start at the beginning - by running the actual project\n10.4.1 Running the ICANT Project\nAs we discovered earlier when reading the documentation you inherited, the project didn’t get very far. They took an off-the-shelf component (Goldpinger), deployed it, and called it a day. All of which is bad news for the project, but good news to me; I have less explaining to do!\nGoldpinger works by querying Kubernetes for all the instances of itself, and then periodically calling each of these instances and measuring the response time. It then uses that data to generate statistics (metrics) and plot a pretty connectivity graph. Each instance works in the same way - it periodically gets the address of its peers, and makes a request to each one of them. This is illustrated in figure 10.4. Goldpinger was invented to detect network slow-downs and problems, especially in larger clusters. It’s really simple and very effective.\nFigure 10.4 Overview of how Goldpinger works\n\nHow do we go about running it? We’ll do it in two steps:\n\nSet up the right permissions, so that Goldpinger can query Kubernetes for its peer\nDeploy it on the cluster\n\nWe’re about to step into Kubernetes Wonderland, so let me introduce you to some Kubernetes lingo.\nKubernetes terminology\nThe documentation often mentions resources to mean the objects representing various abstractions that Kubernetes offers. For now, I’m going to introduce you to three basic building blocks used to describe software on Kubernetes:\n\nPod. A pod is a collection of containers that are grouped together, run on the same host and share some system resources, for example an IP address. This is the unit of software that you can schedule on Kubernetes. You can schedule pods directly, but most of the time you will be using a higher level abstraction, such as a Deployment.\nDeployment. A deployment describes a blueprint for creating pods, along with extra metadata, like for example the number of replicas to run. Importantly, it also manages the lifecycle of pods that it creates. For example, if you modify a deployment to update a version of the image you want to run, the deployment can handle a rollout, deleting old pods and creating new ones one by one to avoid an outage. It also offers other things, like roll-back, if the roll out ever fails.\nService. A service matches an arbitrary set of pods, and provides a single IP address that resolves to the matched pods. That IP is kept up to date with the changes made to the cluster. For example, if a pod goes down, it will be taken out of the pool.\n\nYou can see a visual representation of how these fit together in figure 10.5.\nFigure 10.5 Pods, deployments and services example in Kubernetes\n\nAnother thing you need to know to understand how Goldpinger works is that to query Kubernetes, you need to have the right permissions.\nNOTE POP QUIZ: WHAT’S A KUBERNETES DEPLOYMENT?\nPick one:\n\nA description of how to reach software running on your cluster\nA description of how to deploy some software on your cluster\nA description of how to build a container\n\nSee appendix B for answers.\n\nPermissions\nKubernetes has an elegant way of managing permissions. First, it has a concept of a ClusterRole, that allows you to define a role and a corresponding set of permissions to execute verbs (create, get, delete, list, …) on various resources. Second, it has the concept of ServiceAccounts, which can be linked to any software running on Kubernetes, so that it inherits all the permissions that the ServiceAccount was granted. And finally, to make a link between a ServiceAccount and a ClusterRole, you can use a ClusterRoleBinding, which does exactly what it says on the tin.\nIf you’re new to it, this permissioning might sound a little bit abstract, so take a look at figure 10.6 for a graphical representation of how all of this comes together.\nFigure 10.6 Kubernetes permissioning example\n\nIn our case, we want to allow Goldpinger pods to list its peers, so all we need is a single ClusterRole, and the corresponding ServiceAccount and ClusterRoleBinding. Later, we will use that ServiceAccount to permission the Goldpinger pods.\nCreating the resources\nTime for some code! In Kubernetes, we can describe all resources we want to create using a Yaml file (.yml; https://yaml.org/) that follows the specific format that Kubernetes accepts. See listing 10.1 to see how all of this permissioning translates into .yml. For each element we described, there is a Yaml object, specifying the corresponding type (kind) and the expected parameters. First, a ClusterRole called goldpinger-clusterrol that allows for listing pods (bold font). Then a ServiceAccount called goldpinger-serviceaccount (bold font). And finally, a ClusterRoleBinding, linking the ClusterRole to the ServiceAccount. If you’re new to Yaml, note that the --- separators allow for describing multiple resources in a single file.\nListing 10.1 goldpinger-rbac.yaml\n---\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: ClusterRole                              #A\nmetadata:\n  name: goldpinger-clusterrole\nrules:\n- apiGroups:\n  - \"\"\n  resources:\n  - pods                                       #B\n  verbs:\n  - list                                       #C\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount                           #D\nmetadata:\n  name: goldpinger-serviceaccount\n  namespace: default\n---\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: ClusterRoleBinding\nmetadata:\n  name: goldpinger-clusterrolebinding\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: goldpinger-clusterrole                 #E\nsubjects:\n  - kind: ServiceAccount\n    name: goldpinger-serviceaccount            #F\n    namespace: default\n\n#A we start with a cluster role\n#B the cluster role gets permissions for resource of type pod\n#C the cluster role gets permissions to list the resource of type pod\n#D we create a service account to use later\n#E we create a cluster role binding, that binds the cluster role...\n#F … to the service account\nThis takes care of the permissionsing part. Let’s now go ahead and see what deploying the actual Goldpinger looks like.\nGoldpinger .yml files\nTo make sense of deploying Goldpinger, I need to explain one more detail that I skipped over so far: matching and labels.\nKubernetes makes extensive use of labels, which are simple key-value pairs of type string. Every resource can have arbitrary metadata attached to it, including labels. They are used by Kubernetes to match sets of resources, and are fairly flexible and easy to use.\nFor example, let’s say that you have two pods, with the following labels:\n\nPod A, with labels app=goldpinger and stage=dev\nPod B, with labels app=goldpinger and stage=prod\n\nIf you match (select) all pods with label app=goldpinger, you will get both pods. But if you match with label stage=dev, you will only get pod A. You can also query by multiple labels, and in that case Kubernetes will return pods matching all requested labels (a logical AND).\nLabels are useful for manually grouping resources, but they’re also leveraged by Kubernetes, for example to implement deployments. When you create a deployment, you need to specify the selector (a set of labels to match), and that selector needs to match the pods created by the deployment. The connection between the deployment and the pods it manages relies on labels.\nLabel-matching is also the same mechanism that Goldpinger leverages to query for its peers: it just asks Kubernetes for all pods with a specific label (by default app=goldpinger). Figure 10.7 shows that graphically.\nFigure 10.7 Kubernetes permissioning example\n\nPutting this all together, we can finally write a .yml file with two resource descriptors: a deployment and a matching service.\nInside the deployment, we need to specify the following:\n\nThe number of replicas (we’ll go with three for demonstration purposes)\nThe selector (again the default app=goldpinger),\nThe actual template of pods to create\n\nIn the pod template, we will specify the container image to run, some environment values required for Goldpinger to work and ports to expose so that other instances can reach it. The important bit is that we need to specify some arbitrary port that matches the PORT environment variable (this is what Goldpinger uses to know what port to listen on). We’ll go with 8080. Finally, we also specify the service account we created earlier on, to permission the Goldpinger pods to query Kubernetes for their peers.\nInside the service, we once again use the same selector (app=goldpinger), so that the service matches the pods created by the deployment, and the same port 8080 that we specified on the deployment.\nNOTE DEPLOYMENTS AND DAEMONSETS\nIn a typical installation, we would like to have one Goldpinger pod per node (physical machine, VM) in your cluster. That can be easily achieved by using a DaemonSet (it works a lot like a deployment, but instead of specifying the number of replicas, it just assumes one replica per node - learn more at https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/). In our example setup we will use a Deployment instead, because with only one node, we would only have a single pod of Goldpinger, which defeats the purpose of this demonstration.\n\nListing 10.2 contains the .yml file we can use to create the deployment and the service. Take a look.\nListing 10.2 goldpinger.yml .\n---\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: goldpinger\n  namespace: default\n  labels:\n    app: goldpinger\nspec:\n  replicas: 3                                                #A\n  selector:                                                  #B\n    matchLabels:\n      app: goldpinger\n  template:\n    metadata:                                                #C\n      labels:\n        app: goldpinger\n    spec:\n      serviceAccount: \"goldpinger-serviceaccount\"\n      containers:\n      - name: goldpinger\n        image: \"docker.io/bloomberg/goldpinger:v3.0.0\"\n        env:\n        - name: REFRESH_INTERVAL\n          value: \"2\"\n        - name: HOST\n          value: \"0.0.0.0\"\n        - name: PORT\n          value: \"8080\"                                      #D\n        # injecting real pod IP will make things easier to understand\n        - name: POD_IP\n          valueFrom:\n            fieldRef:\n              fieldPath: status.podIP\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 8080                                #E\n          name: http\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: goldpinger\n  namespace: default\n  labels:\n    app: goldpinger\nspec:\n  type: LoadBalancer\n  ports:\n    - port: 8080                                             #F\n      name: http\n  selector:\n    app: goldpinger                                          #G\n\n#A the deployment will create three replicas of the pods (three pods)\n#B the deployment is configured to match pods with label app=goldpinger\n#C the pods template actually gets the label app=goldpinger\n#D we configure the Goldpinger pods to run on port 8080\n#E we expose the port 8080 on the pod, so that it’s reachable\n#F in the service, we target port 8080 that we made available on the pods\n#G the service will target pods based on the label app=goldpinger\nWith that, we’re now ready to actually start it! If you’re following along, you can find the source code for both of these files (goldpinger-rbac.yml and goldpinger.yml) at https://github.com/seeker89/chaos-engineering-book/tree/master/examples/kubernetes. Let’s make sure that both files are in the same folder, and let’s go ahead and run them.\nDeploying Goldpinger\nStart by creating the permissioning resources (the goldpinger-rbac.yml file), by running the following command: \n   kubectl apply -f goldpinger-rbac.yml\n\nYou will see Kubernetes confirming the three resources were created successfully, with the following output:\nclusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/goldpinger-clusterrole created \n  serviceaccount/goldpinger-serviceaccount created \n  clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/goldpinger-clusterrolebinding created\n\nThen, create the actual deployment and a service by running the following command:\nkubectl apply -f goldpinger.yml\n\nJust like before, you will see the confirmation that the resources were created:\ndeployment.apps/goldpinger created\nservice/goldpinger created\n\nOnce that’s done, let’s confirm that pods are running as expected. To do that, list the pods by running the following command:\nkubectl get pods\n\nYou should see an output similar to the following, with three pods in status Running (bold font). If they’re not, you might need to give it a few seconds to start:\nNAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\ngoldpinger-c86c78448-5kwpp   1/1     Running   0          1m4s\ngoldpinger-c86c78448-gtbvv   1/1     Running   0          1m4s\ngoldpinger-c86c78448-vcwx2   1/1     Running   0          1m4s\n\nThe pods are running, meaning that the deployment did its job. Goldpinger crashes if it can’t list its peers, which means that the permissioning we set up also works as expected. The last thing to check, is that the service was configured correctly. You can do that by running the following command, specifying the name of the service we created (“goldpinger”):\nkubectl describe svc goldpinger\n\nYou will see the details of the service, just like in the following output (abbreviated). Note the Endpoints field, specifying three IP addresses, for the three pods that it’s configured to match.\nName:        goldpinger\nNamespace:                default\nLabels:      app=goldpinger\n(...)\nEndpoints:                172.17.0.3:8080,172.17.0.4:8080,172.17.0.5:8080\n(...)\n\nIf you want to be 100% sure that the IPs are correct, you can compare them to the IPs of Goldpinger pods. You can display them easily, by appending -o wide (for wide output) to the kubectl get pods command. Try it by running the following:\nkubectl get pods -o wide\n\nYou will see the same list as before, but this time with extra details, including the IP (bold font). They should correspond to the list specified in the service. If they weren’t, it would point to misconfigured labels. Note, that depending on your internet connection speed and your setup, it might take a little bit of time to start. If you see pods in pending state, give it an extra minute:\nNAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP           NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES\ngoldpinger-c86c78448-5kwpp   1/1     Running   0          15m   172.17.0.4   minikube              \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-gtbvv   1/1     Running   0          15m   172.17.0.3   minikube              \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-vcwx2   1/1     Running   0          15m   172.17.0.5   minikube              \n\nEverything's up and running, so let’s access Goldpinger to see what it’s really doing. To do that, we’ll need to access the service we created.\nNOTE ACCESSING THE SOFTWARE RUNNING ON KUBERNETES FROM OUTSIDE THE CLUSTER\nKubernetes does a great job standardizing the way people run their software. Unfortunately, not everything is easily standardized. Although every Kubernetes cluster supports services, the way you access the cluster and therefore its services depends on the way the cluster was set up. In this chapter, we will stick to Minikube, because it’s simple and easily accessible to anyone. If you’re running your own Kubernetes cluster, or use a managed solution from one of the cloud providers, accessing software running on the cluster might involve some extra setup (for example setting up an Ingress https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/). Refer to the relevant documentation.\n\nOn Minikube, we can leverage the command minikube service, which will figure out a way to access the service directly from your host machine and open the browser for you. To do that, run the following command:\nminikube service goldpinger\n\nYou will see an output similar to the following, specifying the special URL that Minikube prepared for you (bold font). Your default browser will be launched to open that URL.\n|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n| NAMESPACE |    NAME    | TARGET PORT |             URL             |\n|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n| default   | goldpinger | http/8080   | http://192.168.99.100:30426 |\n|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n🎉  Opening service default/goldpinger in default browser…\n\nInside the newly launched browser window, you will see the Goldpinger UI. It will look similar to what’s shown in figure 10.8. It’s a graph, on which every point represents an instance of Goldpinger, and every arrow represents the last connectivity check (an HTTP request) between the instances. You can click a node to select it and display extra information. It also provides other functionality like a heatmap, showing hotspots of any potential networking slowness; and metrics, providing statistics that can be used to generate alerts and pretty dashboards. Goldpinger is a really handy tool for detecting any network issues, downloaded more than a million times from Docker Hub!\nFigure 10.8 Goldpinger UI in action\n\nFeel free to take some time to play around, but otherwise we’re done setting it all up. We have a running application that we can interact with, all deployed with just two kubectl commands.\nUnfortunately, on our little test cluster, all three instances are running on the same host, so we’re unlikely to see any network slowness, which is pretty boring. Fortunately, as chaos engineering practitioners, we’re well equipped to introduce failure and make things interesting again. Let’s start with the basics - an experiment to kill some pods.\n10.4.2 Experiment 1: kill 50% of pods\nMuch like a villain from a comic book movie, we might be interested in seeing what happens when we kill 50% of Goldpinger pods. Why do that? It’s an inexpensive experiment that can answer a lot of questions about what happens when one of these instances goes down (simulating a machine going down). For example:\n\nDo the other instances detect that to begin with?\nIf so, how long before they detect it?\nHow does Goldpinger configuration affect all of that?\nIf we had an alert set up, would it get triggered?\n\nHow should we go about implementing this? In the previous chapters, we’ve covered different ways this could be addressed. For example, you could log into the machine running the Goldpinger process you want to kill, and simply run a kill command, like we did before. Or, if your cluster uses Docker to run the containers (more on that soon), you could leverage the tools we’ve covered in chapter 5. The point is that all of the techniques you learned in the previous chapter still apply. That said, Kubernetes gives us other options, like directly deleting pods. It’s definitely the most convenient way of achieving that, so let’s go with that option.\nThere is another crucial detail to our experiment: Goldpinger works by periodically making HTTP requests to all of its peers. That period is controlled by the environment variable called REFRESH_PERIOD. In the goldpinger.yml file you deployed, that value was set to 2 seconds:\nname: REFRESH_INTERVAL \n  value: \"2\"\n\nThat means that the maximum time it takes for an instance to notice another instance being down is 2 seconds. This is pretty aggressive and in a large cluster would result in a lot of traffic and CPU time spent on this, but I chose that value for our demonstration purposes. It will be handy to see the changes detected quickly. With that, we now have all the elements, so let’s turn this into a concrete plan of an experiment.\nExperiment 1: plan\nIf we take the first question we mentioned (do other Goldpinger instances detect a peer down), we can design a simple experiment plan like so:\n\nObservability: use Goldpinger UI to see if there are any pods marked as inaccessible; use kubectl to see new pods come and go\nSteady state: all nodes healthy\nHypothesis: if we delete one pod, we should see it in marked as failed in Goldpinger UI, and then be replaced by a new, healthy pod\nRun the experiment\n\nThat’s it! Let’s see how to implement it.\nExperiment 1: implementation\nTo implement this experiment, the pod labels come in useful once again. All we need to do is leverage kubectl get pods to get all pods with label app=goldpinger, pick a random pod and kill it, using kubectl delete. To make things easy, we can also leverage kubectl’s -o name flag to only display the pod names, and use a combination of sort --random-sort and head -n1 to pick a random line of the output. Put all of this together, and you get a script like kube-thanos.sh from listing 10.3. Store it somewhere on your system (or clone it from the Github repo).\nListing 10.3 kube-thanos.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\nkubectl get pods \\                #A\n  -l app=goldpinger \\             #B\n  -o name \\                       #C\n    | sort --random-sort \\        #D\n    | head -n 1 \\                 #E\n    | xargs kubectl delete        #F\n\n#A use kubectl to list pods\n#B only list pods with label app=goldpinger\n#C only display the name as the output\n#D sort in random order\n#E pick the first one\n#F delete the pod\nArmed with that, we’re ready to rock. Let’s run the experiment.\nExperiment 1: run!\nLet’s start by double-checking the steady state. Your Goldpinger installation should still be running and you should have the UI open in a browser window. If it’s not, you can bring both back up by running the following commands:\nkubectl apply -f goldpinger-rbac.yml \n  kubectl apply -f goldpinger.yml \n  minikube service goldpinger\n\nTo confirm all nodes are OK, simply refresh the graph by clicking the “reload” button, and verify that all three nodes are showing in green. So far so good.\nTo confirm that our script works, let’s also set up some observability for the pods being deleted and created. We can leverage the --watch flag of the kubectl get command to print the names of all pods coming and going to the console. You can do that by opening a new terminal window, and running the following command:\nkubectl get pods --watch\n\nYou will see the familiar output, showing all the Goldpinger pods, but this time the command will stay active, blocking the terminal. You can use Ctrl-C to exit at any time, if needed.\nNAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-6rtw4   1/1     Running   0          20h \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-mj76q   1/1     Running   0          19h \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-xbj7s   1/1     Running   0          19h\n\nNow, to the fun part! To conduct our experiment, we’ll open another terminal window for the kube-thanos.sh script, run it to kill a random pod, and then quickly go to the Goldpinger UI to observe what the Goldpinger pods saw. Bear in mind that in the local setup, the pods will recover very rapidly, so you might need to be quick to actually observe the pod becoming unavailable and then healing. In the meantime, the kubectl get pods --watch command will record the pod going down and a replacement coming up. Let’s do that!\nOpen a new terminal window and run the script to kill a random pod:\nbash kube-thanos.sh\n\nYou will see an output showing the name of the pod being deleted, like in the following:\npod \"goldpinger-c86c78448-shtdq\" deleted\n\nGo quickly to the Goldpinger UI and click refresh. You should see some failure, like in figure 10.9. Nodes that can’t be reached by at least one other node will be marked as unhealthy. I marked the unhealthy node in the figure. The live UI also uses a red color to differentiate them. You will also notice that there are four nodes showing up. This is because after the pod is deleted, Kubernetes tries to recoverge to the desired state (three replicas), so it creates a new pod to replace the one we deleted.\nNOTE BE QUICK!\nIf you’re not seeing any errors, the pods probably recovered before you switched to the UI window, because your computer is quicker than mine when I was writing this and chose the parameters. If you re-run the command and refresh the UI more quickly, you should be able to see it.\n\nFigure 10.9 Goldpinger UI showing an unavailable pod being replaced by a new one\n\nNow, go back to the terminal window that is running kubectl get pods --watch. You will see an output similar to the following. Note the pod that we killed (-shtdq) going into Terminating state, and a new pod (-lwxrq) taking its place (both in bold font). You will also notice that the new pod goes through a lifecycle of Pending to ContainerCreating to Running, while the old one goes to Terminating.\nNAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-pfqmc   1/1     Running   0          47s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-shtdq   1/1     Running   0          22s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-xbj7s   1/1     Running   0          20h \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-shtdq   1/1     Terminating   0          38s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-lwxrq   0/1     Pending       0          0s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-lwxrq   0/1     Pending       0          0s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-lwxrq   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-shtdq   0/1     Terminating         0          39s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-lwxrq   1/1     Running             0          2s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-shtdq   0/1     Terminating         0          43s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-shtdq   0/1     Terminating         0          43s\n\nFinally, let’s check that everything recovered smoothly. To do that, go back to the browser window with Goldpinger UI, and refresh once more. You should now see the three new pods happily pinging each other, all in green. Which means that our hypothesis was correct, on both fronts.\nNice job. Another one bites the dust, another experiment under your belt. But before we move on, let’s just discuss a few points.\nNOTE POP QUIZ: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A POD DIES ON A KUBERNETES CLUSTER?\nPick one:\n\nKubernetes detects it and send you an alert\nKubernetes detects it, and will restart it as necessary to make sure the expected number of replicas are running\nNothing\n\nSee appendix B for answers.\n\nExperiment 1: discussion\nFor the sake of teaching, I took a few shortcuts here that I want to make you aware of. First, when accessing the pods through the UI, we’re using a service, which resolves to a pseudo-random instance of Goldpinger every time you make a new call. That means that it’s possible to get routed to the instance we just killed, and get an error in the UI. It also means that every time you refresh the view, you get the reality from a point of view of a different pod. For illustration purposes, that’s not a deal-breaker on a small test cluster but if you run a large cluster and want to make sure that a network partition doesn’t obscure your view, you will need to make sure you consult all available instances, or at least a reasonable subset. Goldpinger addresses that issue with metrics, and you can learn more about that at https://github.com/bloomberg/goldpinger#prometheus\nSecond, using a GUI-based tool this way is a little bit awkward. If you see what you expect, that’s great. But if you don’t, it doesn’t necessarily mean it didn’t happen, it might be that you simply missed it. Again, this can be alleviated by using the metrics, which I skipped here for the sake of simplicity.\nThird, if you look closely at the failures that you see in the graph, you will see that the pods sometimes start receiving traffic before they are actually up. This is because, again for simplicity, I skipped the readiness probe that serves exactly that purpose. If set, a readiness probe prevents a pod from receiving any traffic until a certain condition is met (see the documentation at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/). For an example of how to use it, see the installation docs of Goldpinger (https://github.com/bloomberg/goldpinger#installation).\nFinally, remember that depending on the refresh period you’re running Goldpinger with, the data you’re looking at is up to that many seconds stale, which means that for the pods we killed, we’ll keep seeing them for an extra number of seconds equal to the refresh period (2 seconds in our setup).\nThese are the caveats my lawyers advised me to clarify before this goes to print. In case that makes you think I’m not fun at parties, let me prove you wrong. Let’s play some Invaders, like it’s 1978.\n10.4.3 Party trick: killing pods in style\nIf you really want to make a point that chaos engineering is fun, I’ve got two tools for you.\nFirst, KubeInvaders (https://github.com/lucky-sideburn/KubeInvaders). It gamifies the process of killing pods by starting a clone of Space Invaders, where the aliens are pods in the specified namespace. You guessed it, the ones you shoot down are deleted in Kubernetes. Installation involves deploying it on a cluster, and then connecting a local client that actually displays the game content. See figure 10.10 to see what it looks like in action.\nFigure 10.10 Kubeinvader screenshot from https://github.com/lucky-sideburn/KubeInvaders\n\nThe second one is for fans of the first-person shooter genre: Kube DOOM (https://github.com/storax/kubedoom). Similar to KubeInvaders, it represents pods as enemies, and kills in Kubernetes the ones that die in the game. Tip to justify using it: it’s often much quicker than copying and pasting a name of a pod, saving so much time (mandatory reference: https://xkcd.com/303/). See figure 10.11 for a screenshot.\nFigure 10.11 Kube DOOM screenshot from https://github.com/storax/kubedoom\n\nFor Kube DOOM, the installation is pretty straightforward: you run a pod on the host, pass a kubectl configuration file to it, and then use a desktop sharing client to connect to the game. After a long day of debugging, it might be just what you need. I’ll just leave it there.\nI’m sure that will help with your next house party. When you finish the game, let’s take a look at another experiment - some good old network slowness.\n10.4.4 Experiment 2: network slowness\nSlowness, my nemesis, we meet again. If you’re a software engineer, chances are you’re spending a lot of your time trying to outwit slowness. When things go wrong, actual failure is often easier to debug than situations when things mostly work. And slowness tends to fall into the latter category.\nSlowness is such an important topic that we touch upon it in nearly every chapter of this book. We introduced some slowness using tc in chapter 4, and then again using Pumba in Docker in chapter 5. We use some in the context of JVM, application level ,and even browser in other chapters. Time to take a look at what’s different when running on Kubernetes.\nIt’s worth mentioning that everything we covered before still applies here. We could very well use tc or Pumba directly on one of the machines running the processes we’re interested in, and modify them to introduce the failure we care about. In fact, using kubectl cp and kubectl exec, we could upload and execute tc commands directly in a pod, without even worrying about accessing the host. Or we could even add a second container to the Goldpinger pod that would execute the necessary tc commands.\nAll of these options are viable, but share one downside: they modify the existing software that’s running on your cluster, and so by definition carry risks of messing things up. A convenient alternative is to add extra software, tweaked to implement the failure we care about, but otherwise identical to the original and introduce the extra software in a way that will integrate with the rest of the system. Kubernetes makes it really easy. Let me show you what I mean; let’s design an experiment around simulated network slowness.\nExperiment 2: plan\nLet’s say that we want to see what happens when one instance of Goldpinger is slow to respond to queries of its peers. After all, this is what this piece of software was designed to help with, so before we rely on it, we should test that it works as expected.\nA convenient way of doing that is to deploy a copy of Goldpinger that we can modify to add a delay. Once again, we could do it with tc, but to show you some new tools, let’s use a standalone network proxy instead. That proxy will sit in front of that new Goldpinger instance, receive the calls from its peers, add the delay, and relay the calls to Goldpinger. Thanks to Kubernetes, setting it all up is pretty straightforward.\nLet’s iron out some details. Goldpinger’s default timeout for all calls is 300ms, so let’s pick an arbitrary value of 250ms for our delay: enough to be clearly seen, but not enough to cause a timeout. And thanks to the built-in heatmap, we will be able to visually show the connections that take longer than others, so the observability aspect is taken care of. The plan of the experiment figuratively writes itself:\n\nObservability: use Goldpinger UI to read delays using the graph UI and the heatmap\nSteady state: all existing Goldpinger instantes report healthy\nHypothesis: if we add a new instance that has a 250ms delay, the connectivity graph will show all four instances healthy, and the 250ms delay will be visible in the heatmap\nRun the experiment!\n\nSounds good? Let’s see how to implement it.\nExperiment 2: implementation\nTime to dig into what the implementation will look like. Do you remember figure 10.4 that showed how Goldpinger worked? Let me copy it for your convenience in figure 10.12. Every instance asks Kubernetes for all its peers, and then periodically makes calls to them to measure latency and detect problems.\nFigure 10.12 Overview of how Goldpinger works (again)\n\nNow, what we want to do is add a copy of the Goldpinger pod that has the extra proxy we just discussed in front of it. A pod in Kubernetes can have multiple containers running alongside each other and able to communicate via localhost. If we use the same label app=goldpinger, the other instances will detect the new pod and start calling. But we will configure the ports in a way that instead of directly reaching the new instance, the peers will first reach the proxy (in port 8080). And the proxy will add the desired latency. The extra Goldpinger instance will be able to ping the other hosts freely, like a regular instance. This is summarized in figure 10.13.\nFigure 10.13 A modified copy of Goldpinger with an extra proxy in front of it\n\nWe’ve got the idea of what the setup will look like, now we need the actual networking proxy. Goldpinger communicates via HTTP/1.1, so we’re in luck. It’s a text-based, reasonably simple protocol running on top of TCP. All we need is the protocol specification (RFC 72301, RFC 72312, RFC 72323, RFC 72334 and RFC 72345) and we should be able to implement a quick proxy in no time. Dust off your C compiler, stretch your arms, and let’s do it!\nExperiment 2: Toxiproxy\nJust kidding! We’ll use an existing, open-source project designed for this kind of thing, called Toxiproxy (https://github.com/shopify/toxiproxy). It works as a proxy on TCP level (L4 OSI model), which is fine for us, because we don’t actually need to understand anything about what’s going on on the HTTP level (L7) to introduce a simple latency. The added benefit is that you can use the same tool for any other TCP-based protocol in the exact same way, so what we’re about to do will be equally applicable to a lot of other popular software, like Redis, MySQL, PostgreSQL and many more.\nToxiProxy consists of two pieces:\n\nthe actual proxy server, which exposes an API you can use to configure what should be proxied where and the kind of failure that you expect\nand a CLI client, that connects to that API and can change the configuration live\n\nNOTE CLI AND API\nInstead of using the CLI, you can also talk to the API directly, and ToxiProxy offers ready-to-use clients in a variety of languages.\n\nThe dynamic nature of ToxiProxy makes it really useful when used in unit and integration testing. For example, your integration test could start by configuring the proxy to add latency when connecting to a database, and then your test could verify that timeouts are triggered accordingly. It’s also going to be handy for us in implementing our experiment.\nThe version we’ll use, 2.1.4 (https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy/releases/tag/v2.1.4), is the latest available release at the time of writing. We’re going to run the proxy server as part of the extra Goldpinger pod using a prebuilt, publicly available image from Docker Hub. We’ll also need to use the CLI locally on your machine. To install it, download the CLI executable for your system (Ubuntu/Debian, Windows, MacOS) from https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy/releases/tag/v2.1.4 and add it to your PATH. To confirm it works, run the following command:\ntoxiproxy-cli –version\nYou should see the version 2.1.4 displayed, like in the following output:\ntoxiproxy-cli version 2.1.4\nWhen a ToxiProxy server starts, by default it doesn’t do anything apart from running its HTTP API. By calling the API, you can configure and dynamically change the behavior of the proxy server. You can define arbitrary configurations defined by:\n\na unique name\na host and port to bind to and listen for connections\na destination server to proxy to\n\nFor every configuration like this, you can attach failures. In ToxiProxy lingo, these failures are called “toxics”. Currently, the following toxics are available:\n\nlatency - add arbitrary latency to the connection (in either direction)\ndown - take the connection down\nbandwidth - throttle the connection to the desired speed\nslow close - delay the TCP socket from closing for an arbitrary time\ntimeout - wait for an arbitrary time and then close the connection\nslicer - slices the received data into smaller bits before sending it to the destination\n\nYou can attach an arbitrary combination of failures to every proxy configuration you define. For our needs, the latency toxic will do exactly what we want it to. Let’s see how all of this fits together.\nNOTE POP QUIZ: WHAT’S TOXIPROXY?\nPick one:\n\nA configurable TCP proxy, that can simulate various problems, like dropped packets or network slowness\nA K-pop band singing about the environmental consequences of dumping large amounts of toxic waste sent to third world countries through the use of proxy and shell companies\n\nSee appendix B for answers.\n\nExperiment 2: implementation continued\nTo sum it all up, we want to create a new pod with two containers: one for Goldpinger and one for the ToxiProxy. We’ll need to configure Goldpinger to run on a different port, so that the proxy can listen on the default port 8080 that the other Goldpinger instances will try to connect to. We’ll also create a service that routes connections to the proxy API on port 8474, so that we can use toxiproxy-cli commands to configure the proxy and add the latency that we want,just like in figure 10.14.\nFigure 10.14 Interacting with the modified version of Goldpinger using toxiproxy-cli\n\nLet’s now translate this into a Kubernetes .yml file. You can see the resulting goldpinger-chaos.yml in listing 10.4. You will see two resource descriptions, a pod (with two containers) and a service. Note, that we use the same service account we created before, to give Goldpinger the same permissions. We’re also using two environment variables, PORT and CLIENT_PORT_OVERRIDE, to make Goldpinger listen on port 9090, but call its peers on port 8080, respectively. This is because by default, Goldpinger calls its peers on the same port that it runs itself. Finally, notice that the service is using a label chaos=absolutely to match to the new pod we created. It’s important that the Goldpinger pod has the label app=goldpinger, so that it can be found by its peers, but we also need another label to be able to route connections to the proxy API.\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: goldpinger-chaos\n  namespace: default\n  labels:\n    app: goldpinger                                #A\n    chaos: absolutely\nspec:\n  serviceAccount: \"goldpinger-serviceaccount\"      #B\n  containers:\n  - name: goldpinger\n    image: docker.io/bloomberg/goldpinger:v3.0.0\n    env:\n    - name: REFRESH_INTERVAL\n      value: \"2\"\n    - name: HOST\n      value: \"0.0.0.0\"\n    - name: PORT\n      value: \"9090\"                               #C\n    - name: CLIENT_PORT_OVERRIDE\n      value: \"8080\"\n    - name: POD_IP\n      valueFrom:\n        fieldRef:\n          fieldPath: status.podIP\n  - name: toxiproxy\n    image: docker.io/shopify/toxiproxy:2.1.4\n    ports:\n    - containerPort: 8474                         #D\n      name: toxiproxy-api\n    - containerPort: 8080\n      name: goldpinger\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: goldpinger-chaos\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  type: LoadBalancer\n  ports:\n    - port: 8474                                  #E\n      name: toxiproxy-api\n  selector:\n    chaos: absolutely                             #F\n\n#A the new pod has the same label app=goldpinger to be detected by its peers, but also chaos=absolutely to be matched by the proxy api service\n#B we use the same service account as other instances to give Goldpinger permission to list its peers\n#C we use HOST envvar to make Goldpinger listen on port 9090, and CLIENT_PORT_OVERRIDE to make it call itse peers on the default port 8080\n#D ToxiProxy container will expose two ports: 8474 with the ToxiProxy API and 8080 to proxy through to Goldpinger\n#E the service will route traffic to port 8474 (ToxiProxy API)\n#F the service will use label chaos=absolutely to select the pods running ToxiProxy\nAnd that’s all we need. Make sure you have this file handy (or clone it from the repo like before). Ready to rock? Let the games begin!\nExperiment 2: run!\nTo run this experiment, we’re going to use the Goldpinger UI. If you closed the browser window before, restart it by running the following command in the terminal:\nminikube service goldpinger\nLet’s start with the steady state, and confirm that all three nodes are visible and report as healthy. In the top bar, click Heatmap. You will see a heatmap similar to the one in figure 10.15. Each square represents connectivity between nodes and is color-coded based on the time it took to execute a request.\n\nColumns represent source (from)\nRows represent destinations (to)\nThe legend clarifies which number corresponds to which pod.\n\nIn this example, all squares are the same color and shade, meaning that all requests took below 2ms, which is to be expected when all instances run on the same host. You can also tweak the values to your liking and click “refresh” to show a new heatmap. Close it when you’re ready.\nFigure 10.15 Example of Goldpinger Heatmap\n\nLet’s introduce our new pod! To do that, we’ll kubectl apply the goldpinger-chaos.yml file from listing 10.4. Run the following command:\nkubectl apply -f goldpinger-chaos.yml\nYou will see an output confirming creation of a pod and service:\npod/goldpinger-chaos created\nservice/goldpinger-chaos created\nLet’s confirm it’s running by going to the UI. You will now see an extra node, just like in figure 10.16. But notice that the new pod is marked as unhealthy - all of its peers are failing to connect to it. In the live UI, the node is marked in red, and in the figure 10.16 I annotated the new, unhealthy node for you. This is because we haven’t configured the proxy to pass the traffic yet.\nFigure 10.16 Extra Goldpinger instance, detected by its peers, but inaccessible\n\nLet’s address that by configuring the ToxiProxy. This is where the extra service we deployed comes in handy: we will use it to connect to the ToxiProxy API using toxiproxy-cli. Do you remember how we used minikube service to get a special URL to access the Goldpinger service? We’ll leverage that again, but this time with the --url flag, to only print the url itself. Run the following command in a bash session to store the url in a variable:\nTOXIPROXY_URL=$(minikube service --url goldpinger-chaos)\nWe can now use the variable to point toxiproxy-cli to the right ToxiProxy API. That’s done using the -h flag. Confusingly, -h is not for “help”, it’s for “host”. Let’s confirm it works by listing the existing proxy configuration:\ntoxiproxy-cli -h $TOXIPROXY_URL list\nYou will see the following output, saying there are no proxies configured. It even goes so far as to hint we create some proxies (bold font):\nName       Listen          Upstream                Enabled         Toxics\nno proxies\n\nHint: create a proxy with `toxiproxy-cli create`\nLet’s configure one. We’ll call it chaos, make it route to localhost:9090 (where we configured Goldpinger to listen to) and listen on 0.0.0.0:8080 to make it accessible to its peers to call. Run the following command to make that happen:\ntoxiproxy-cli \\ \n  -h $TOXIPROXY_URL \\        #A\n  create chaos \\             #B\n  -l 0.0.0.0:8080 \\          #C\n  -u localhost:9090          #D\n#A connect to specific proxy\n#B create a new proxy configuration called “chaos”\n#C listen on 0.0.0.0:8080 (default Goldpinger port)\n#D relay connections to localhost:9090 (where we configured Goldpinger to run)\nYou will see a simple confirmation that the proxy was created:\nCreated new proxy chaos\nRerun the toxiproxy-cli list command to see the new proxy appear this time:\ntoxiproxy-cli -h $TOXIPROXY_URL list\nYou will see the following output, listing a new proxy configuration called “chaos” (bold font):\nName       Listen          Upstream                Enabled         Toxics \n  ================================================ \n  chaos      [::]:8080       localhost:9090          enabled         None \n\nHint: inspect toxics with `toxiproxy-cli inspect `\nIf you go back to the UI and click refresh, you will see that the goldpinger-chaos extra instance is now green, and all instances happily report healthy state in all directions. If you check the heatmap, it will also show all green.\nLet’s change that. Using the command toxiproxy-cli toxic add, let’s add a single toxic with 250ms latency. Do that by running the following command:\ntoxiproxy-cli \\\n-h $TOXIPROXY_URL \\\ntoxic add \\                  #A\n--type latency \\             #B\n--a latency=250 \\            #C\n--upstream \\                 #D\nchaos                        #E\n#A add a toxic to an existing proxy configuration\n#B toxic type is latency\n#C we want to add 250ms of latency\n#D we set it in the upstream direction, towards the Goldpinger instance\n#E we attach this toxic to a proxy configuration called “chaos”\nYou will see a confirmation:\nAdded upstream latency toxic 'latency_upstream' on proxy 'chaos'\nTo confirm that the proxy got it right, we can inspect our proxy called “chaos”. To do that, run the following command:\ntoxiproxy-cli -h $TOXIPROXY_URL inspect chaos\nYou will see an output just like the following, listing our brand new toxic (bold font):\nName: chaos     Listen: [::]:8080       Upstream: localhost:9090 \n  ====================================================================== \n  Upstream toxics: \n  latency_upstream:       type=latency    stream=upstream toxicity=1.00   attributes=[    jitter=0        latency=250     ] \n\n  Downstream toxics: \n  Proxy has no Downstream toxics enabled.\nNow, go back to the Goldpinger UI in the browser and refresh. You will still see all four instances reporting healthy and happy (the 250ms delay fits within the default timeout of 300ms). But if you open the heatmap, this time it will tell a different story. The row with goldpinger-chaos pod will be marked in red (problem threshold), implying that all its peers detected slowness. See figure 10.17 for a screenshot.\nFigure 10.17 Goldpinger heatmap, showing slowness accessing pod goldpinger-chaos\n\nThis means that our hypothesis was correct: Goldpinger correctly detects and reports the slowness, and at 250ms, below the default timeout of 300ms, the Goldpinger graph UI reports all as healthy. And we did all of that without modifying the existing pods.\nThis wraps up the experiment, but before we go, let’s clean up the extra pod. To do that, run the following command to delete everything we created using the goldpinger-chaos.yml file:\nkubectl delete -f goldpinger-chaos.yml\nLet’s discuss our findings.\nExperiment 2: Discussion\nHow well did we do? We took some time to learn new tools, but the entire implementation of the experiment boiled down to a single .yml file and a handful of commands with ToxiProxy. We also had a tangible benefit of working on a copy of the software that we wanted to test, leaving the existing running processes unmodified. We effectively rolled out some extra capacity and then had 25% of running software affected, limiting the blast radius. Does it mean we could do that in production? As with any sufficiently complex question, the answer is, “it depends.” In this example, if we wanted to verify the robustness of some alerting that relies on metrics from Goldpinger to trigger, this could be a good way to do it. But the extra software could also affect the existing instances in a more profound way, making it more risky. At the end of the day, it really depends on your application.\nThere is, of course, room for improvement. For example, the service we’re using to access the Goldpinger UI is routing traffic to any instance matched in a pseudo-random fashion. That means that sometimes it will route to the instance that has the 250ms delay. In our case, that will be difficult to spot with the naked eye, but if you wanted to test a larger delay, it could be a problem.\nTime to wrap up this first part.

In the previous chapter we set things up manually to build the understanding of how to implement the experiment. But now that you know that, I want to show you how much more quickly you can go when using the right tools. Enter PowerfulSeal.\n"},"docs/Automating_chaos_with_PowerfulSeal.html":{"url":"docs/Automating_chaos_with_PowerfulSeal.html","title":"11.1 Automating chaos with PowerfulSeal","keywords":"","body":"11.1 Automating chaos with PowerfulSeal\nIt’s often said that software engineering is one of the very few jobs where being lazy is a good thing. And I tend to agree with that; a lot of automation or reducing toil can be seen as a manifestation of being too lazy to do manual labor. Automation also reduces operator errors and improves speed and accuracy.\nThe tools for automation of chaos experiments are steadily becoming more advanced and mature. For a good, up-to-date list of available tools, it’s worth checking out the Awesome Chaos Engineering list (https://github.com/dastergon/awesome-chaos-engineering). For Kubernetes, I recommend PowerfulSeal (https://github.com/powerfulseal/powerfulseal), created by yours truly, that we’re going to use here. Other good options include Chaos Toolkit (https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit) and Litmus (https://litmuschaos.io/).\nIn this section, we’re going to build on the two experiments we implemented manually to make you more efficient the next time. In fact, we’re going to re-implement a slight variation of these experiments, each in 5 minutes flat. So, what’s PowerfulSeal again?\n11.1.1 What’s PowerfulSeal?\nPowerfulSeal is a chaos engineering tool for Kubernetes. It has quite a few features:\n\ninteractive mode helping you understand how software on your cluster works and manually break it\nintegrating with your cloud provider to take VMs up and down\nautomatically killing pods marked with special labels\nautonomous mode supporting sophisticated scenarios\n\nThe latter point in this list is the functionality we’ll focus on here.\nThe autonomous mode allows you to implement chaos experiments by writing a simple .yml file. Inside that file, you can write any number of scenarios, each listing the steps necessary to implement, validate, and clean up after your experiment. There are plenty of options you can use (documented at https://powerfulseal.github.io/powerfulseal/policies), but at its heart, it’s a very simple format. The .yml file containing scenarios is referred to as a policy file.\nTo give you an example, take a look at listing 11.1. It contains a simple policy file, with a single scenario, with a single step. That single step is an HTTP probe. It will try to make an HTTP request to the designated endpoint of the specified service, and fail the scenario if that doesn’t work.\nListing 11.1 powerfulseal-policy-minimal.yml\nscenarios:\n- name: Just check that my service responds\n  steps:\n  - probeHTTP:                   #A\n      target:\n        service:\n          name: my-service       #B\n          namespace: myapp\n      endpoint: /healthz         #C\n\n#A instruct PowerfulSeal to conduct an HTTP probe\n#B target service my-service in namespace myapp\n#C call the /healthz endpoint on that service\nOnce you have your policy file ready, there are many ways you can run PowerfulSeal. Typically, it tends to be used either from your local machine -- the same one you use to interact with the Kubernetes cluster (useful for development) -- or as a Deployment running directly on the cluster (useful for ongoing, continuous experiments).\nTo run, PowerfulSeal needs permission to interact with the Kubernetes cluster, either through a ServiceAccount, like we did with Goldpinger in chapter 10, or through specifying a kubectl config file. If you want to manipulate VMs in your cluster, you’ll also need to configure access to the cloud provider. With that, you can start PowerfulSeal in autonomous mode and let it execute your scenario. PowerfulSeal will go through the policy and execute scenarios step by step, killing pods and taking down VMs as appropriate. Take a look at figure 11.1 that shows what this setup looks like visually.\nFigure 11.1 Setting up PowerfulSeal\n\nAnd that’s it. Point it at a cluster, tell it what your experiment is like, and watch it do the work for you! We’re almost ready to get our hands dirty, but before we do, we’ll need to install PowerfulSeal.\nNOTE POP QUIZ: WHAT DOES POWEFULSEAL DO?\nPick one:\n\nIllustrates - in equal measures - the importance and futility of trying to pick up good names in software\nGuesses what kind of chaos you might need by looking at your Kubernetes clusters\nAllows you to write a Yaml file to describe how to run and validate chaos experiments\n\nSee appendix B for answers.\n\n11.1.2 PowerfulSeal - installation\nPowerfulSeal is written in Python, and it’s distributed in two forms:\n\na pip package called powerfulseal\na Docker image called powerfulseal/powerfulseal on Docker Hub\n\nFor the two examples we’re going to run, it will be much easier to run PowerfulSeal locally, so let’s install it through pip. It requires Python3.7+ and pip available.\nTo install it using a virtualenv (recommended), run the following commands in a terminal window to create a subfolder called env and install everything in it:\npython3 --version                #A\npython3 -m virtualenv env        #B\nsource env/bin/activate          #C\npip install powerfulseal         #D\n#A check the version to make sure it’s python3.7\n#B create a new virtualenv in the current working directory, called env\n#C activate the new virtualenv\n#D install powerfulseal from pip\nDepending on your internet connection, the last step might take a minute or two. When it’s done, you will have a new command accessible, called powerfulseal. Try it out by running the following command:\npowerfulseal --version\nYou will see the version printed, corresponding to the latest version available. If, at any point, you need help, feel free to consult the help pages of PowerfulSeal, by running the following command:\npowerfulseal --help\nWith that, we’re ready to roll. Let’s see what experiment 1 would look like using PowerfulSeal.\n11.1.3 Experiment 1b: kill 50% of pods\nAs a reminder, this was our plan for experiment 1:\n\nObservability: use Goldpinger UI to see if there are any pods marked as inaccessible; use kubectl to see new pods come and go\nSteady state: all nodes healthy\nHypothesis: if we delete one pod, we should see it in marked as failed in Goldpinger UI, and then be replaced by a new, healthy pod\nRun the experiment\n\nWe have already covered the observability, but if you closed the browser window with the Goldpinger UI, here’s a refresher. Open the Goldpinger UI by running the following command in a terminal window:\nminikube service goldpinger\nAnd just like before, we’d like to have a way to see what pods were created and deleted. To do that, we leverage the --watch flag of the kubectl get pods command. In another terminal window, start a kubectl command to print all changes:\nkubectl get pods --watch\nNow, to the actual experiment. Fortunately, it translates one-to-one to a built-in feature of PowefulSeal. Actions on pods are done using PodAction (I’m good at naming like that). Every PodAction consists of three steps:\n\nmatch some pods, for example based on labels\nfilter the pods (various filters available, for example take a 50% subset)\napply an action on pods (for example, kill them)\n\nThis translates directly into experiment1b.yml that you can see in listing 11.2. Store it or clone it from the repo.\nListing 11.2 experiment1b.yml\nconfig:\n  runStrategy:\n    runs: 1                                      #A\nscenarios:\n- name: Kill 50% of Goldpinger nodes\n  steps:\n  - podAction:\n      matches:                                   #B\n        - labels:\n            selector: app=goldpinger\n            namespace: default\n      filters:                                   #C\n        - randomSample:\n            ratio: 0.5\n      actions:                                   #D\n        - kill:\n            force: true\n\n#A only run the scenario once, and then exit\n#B select all pods in namespace default, with labels app=goldpinger\n#C filter out to only take 50% of the matched pods\n#D kill the pods\nYou must be itching to run it, so let’s not wait any longer. On Minikube, the kubectl config is stored in ~/.kube/config, and it will be automatically picked up when you run PowerfulSeal. So the only argument we need to specify is the policy file (--policy-file) flag. Run the following command, pointing to the experiment1b.yml file:\npowerfulseal autonomous --policy-file experiment1b.yml\nYou will see an output similar to the following (abbreviated). Note the lines when it says it found three pods, filtered out two and selected a pod to be killed (bold font):\n(...) \n  2020-08-25 09:51:20 INFO __main__ STARTING AUTONOMOUS MODE \n  2020-08-25 09:51:20 INFO scenario.Kill 50% of Gol Starting scenario 'Kill 50% of Goldpinger nodes' (1 steps) \n  2020-08-25 09:51:20 INFO action_nodes_pods.Kill 50% of Gol Matching 'labels' {'labels': {'selector': 'app=goldpinger', 'namespace': 'default'}} \n  2020-08-25 09:51:20 INFO action_nodes_pods.Kill 50% of Gol Matched 3 pods for selector app=goldpinger in namespace default \n  2020-08-25 09:51:20 INFO action_nodes_pods.Kill 50% of Gol Initial set length: 3 \n  2020-08-25 09:51:20 INFO action_nodes_pods.Kill 50% of Gol Filtered set length: 1 \n  2020-08-25 09:51:20 INFO action_nodes_pods.Kill 50% of Gol Pod killed: [pod #0 name=goldpinger-c86c78448-8lfqd namespace=default containers=1 ip=172.17.0.3 host_ip=192.168.99.100 state=Running labels:app=goldpinger,pod-template-hash=c86c78448 annotations:] \n  2020-08-25 09:51:20 INFO scenario.Kill 50% of Gol Scenario finished \n  (...)\nIf you’re quick enough, you will see a pod becoming unavailable and then replaced by a new pod in the Goldpinger UI, just like you did the first time we ran this experiment. And in the terminal window running kubectl, you will see the familiar sight, confirming that a pod was killed (goldpinger-c86c78448-8lfqd) and then replaced with a new one (goldpinger-c86c78448-czbkx):\nNAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE \n  goldpinger-c86c78448-lwxrq   1/1     Running   1          45h \n  goldpinger-c86c78448-tl9xq   1/1     Running   0          40m \n  goldpinger-c86c78448-xqfvc   1/1     Running   0          8m33s \n  goldpinger-c86c78448-8lfqd   1/1     Terminating   0          41m \n  goldpinger-c86c78448-8lfqd   1/1     Terminating   0          41m \n  goldpinger-c86c78448-czbkx   0/1     Pending       0          0s \n  goldpinger-c86c78448-czbkx   0/1     Pending       0          0s \n  goldpinger-c86c78448-czbkx   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s \n  goldpinger-c86c78448-czbkx   1/1     Running             0          2s\nThat concludes the first experiment and shows you the ease of use of higher level tools like PowerfulSeal. But we’re just warming up. Let’s take a look at experiment 2 once again, this time using the new toys.\n11.1.4 Experiment 2b: network slowness\nAs a reminder, this was our plan for experiment 2:\n\nObservability: use Goldpinger UI to read delays using the graph UI and the heatmap\nSteady state: all existing Goldpinger instances report healthy\nHypothesis: if we add a new instance that has a 250ms delay, the connectivity graph will show all four instances healthy, and the 250ms delay will be visible in the heatmap\nRun the experiment!\n\nIt’s a perfectly good plan, so let’s use it again. But this time, instead of manually setting up a new deployment and doing the gymnastics to point the right port to the right place, we’ll leverage the clone feature of PowerfulSeal.\nIt works like this. You point it at a source deployment that it will copy at runtime (the deployment must exist on the cluster). This is to make sure that we don’t break the existing running software, and instead add an extra instance, just like we did before. And then you can specify a list of mutations that PowerfulSeal will apply to the deployment to achieve specific goals. Of particular interest is the toxiproxy mutation. It does almost exactly the same thing that we did:\n\nadd a toxiproxy container to the deployment\nconfigure toxiproxy to create a proxy configuration for each port specified on the deployment\nautomatically redirect the traffic incoming to each port specified in the original deployment to its corresponding proxy port\nconfigure any toxics requested\n\nThe only real difference between what we did before and what PowefulSeal does is the automatic redirection of ports, which means that we don’t need to change any ports configuration in the deployment.\nTo implement this scenario using PowerfulSeal, we need to write another policy file. It’s pretty straightforward. We need to use the clone feature, and specify the source deployment to clone. To introduce the network slowness, we can add a mutation of type toxiproxy, with a toxic on port 8080, of type latency, with the latency attribute set to 250ms. And just to show you how easy it is to use, let’s set the number of replicas affected to 2. That means that two replicas out of the total of five (three from the original deployment plus these two), or 40% of the traffic will be affected. Also note that at the end of a scenario, PowerfulSeal cleans up after itself by deleting the clone it created. To give you enough time to look around, let’s add a wait of 120 seconds before that happens.\nWhen translated into Yaml, it looks like the file experiment2b.yml that you can see in listing 11.3. Take a look.\nListing 11.3 experiment2b.yml\nconfig:\n  runStrategy:\n    runs: 1\nscenarios:\n- name: Toxiproxy latency\n  steps:\n  - clone:                                       #A\nsource:\n        deployment:                              #B\n          name: goldpinger\n          namespace: default\n      replicas: 2                                #C\n      mutations:\n        - toxiproxy:\n            toxics:\n              - targetProxy: \"8080\"              #D\n                toxicType: latency\n                toxicAttributes:\n     - name: latency                             #E\n       value: 250\n  - wait:\n      seconds: 120                               #F\n\n#A use the clone feature of PowerfulSeal\n#B clone the deployment called “goldpinger” in the default namespace\n#C use two replicas of the clone\n#D target port 8080 (the one that Goldpinger is running on)\n#E specify latency of 250ms\n#F wait for 120 seconds\nNOTE BRINGING GOLDPINGER BACK UP AGAIN\nIf you got rid of the Goldpinger deployment from experiment 2, you can bring it back up by running the following command in a terminal window:\nkubectl apply -f goldpinger-rbac.yml\nkubectl apply -f goldpinger.yml\n\nYou’ll see a confirmation of the created resources. After a few seconds, you will be able to see the Goldpinger UI in the browser by running the following command:\nminikube service goldpinger\nYou will see the familiar graph with three goldpinger nodes, just like in chapter 10. See figure 11.2 for a reminder of what it looks like.\nFigure 11.2 Goldpinger UI in action\n\nLet’s execute the experiment. Run the following command in a terminal window:\npowerfulseal autonomous --policy-file experiment2b.yml\nYou will see PowerfulSeal creating the clone, and then eventually deleting it, similar to the following output:\n(...)\n2020-08-31 10:49:32 INFO __main__ STARTING AUTONOMOUS MODE \n  2020-08-31 10:49:33 INFO scenario.Toxiproxy laten Starting scenario 'Toxiproxy latency' (2 steps) \n  2020-08-31 10:49:33 INFO action_clone.Toxiproxy laten Clone deployment created successfully \n  2020-08-31 10:49:33 INFO scenario.Toxiproxy laten Sleeping for 120 seconds \n  2020-08-31 10:51:33 INFO scenario.Toxiproxy laten Scenario finished \n  2020-08-31 10:51:33 INFO scenario.Toxiproxy laten Cleanup started (1 items) \n  2020-08-31 10:51:33 INFO action_clone Clone deployment deleted successfully: goldpinger-chaos in default \n  2020-08-31 10:51:33 INFO scenario.Toxiproxy laten Cleanup done \n  2020-08-31 10:51:33 INFO policy_runner All done here!\nDuring the 2-minute wait you configured, check the Goldpinger UI. You will see a graph with five nodes. When all pods come up, the graph will show all healthy. But there is more to it. Click the heatmap, and you will see that the cloned pods (they will have “chaos” in their name) are slow to respond. But if you look closely, you will notice that the connections they are making to themselves are unaffected. That’s because PowerfulSeal doesn’t inject itself into communications on localhost. Click the heatmap button. You will see a heatmap similar to figure 11.2. Note that the squares on the diagonal (pods calling themselves) remain unaffected by the added latency.\nFigure 11.3 Goldpinger heatmap showing two pods with added latency, injected by PowerfulSeal\n\nThat concludes the experiment. Wait for PowerfulSeal to clean up after itself and delete the cloned deployment. When it’s finished (it will exit(, let’s move on to the next topic: ongoing testing.\n"},"docs/Ongoing_testing_Service_Level_Objectives_SLOs.html":{"url":"docs/Ongoing_testing_Service_Level_Objectives_SLOs.html","title":"11.2 Ongoing testing & Service Level Objectives (SLOs)","keywords":"","body":"11.2 Ongoing testing & Service Level Objectives (SLOs)\nSo far, all the experiments we’ve conducted were designed to verify a hypothesis and call it a day. Like everything in science, a single counter-example is enough to prove a hypothesis wrong, but absence of such counter-example doesn’t prove anything. And sometimes our hypotheses are about normal functioning of a system, where various events might occur and influence the outcome.\nTo illustrate what I mean, let me give you an example. Think of a typical Service Level Agreement (SLA) that you might see for a Platform as a Service (PaaS). Let’s say that your product is to offer managed services, similar to AWS Lambda (https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), where the client can make an API call specifying a location of some code, and your platform will build, deploy, and run that service for them. Your clients care deeply about the speed at which they can deploy new versions of their services, so they want an SLA for the time it takes from their request to their service being ready to serve traffic. To keep things simple, let’s say that the time for building their code is excluded, and the time to deploy it on your platform is agreed to be one minute.\nAs the engineer responsible for that system, you need to work backward from that constraint to set up the system in a way that can satisfy these requirements. You design an experiment to verify that a typical request you expect to see in your clients fits in that timeline. You run it, turns out it only takes about 30 seconds, the champagne cork is popping and the party starts! Or does it?\nWhen you run the experiment like this and it works, what you actually proved is that the system behaved the expected way during the experiment. But does it guarantee that it will work the same way in different conditions (peak traffic, different usage patterns, different data)? Typically, the larger and more complex the system is, the harder it is to answer that question. And that’s a problem, especially if the SLAs you signed have financial penalties for missing the goals.\nFortunately, chaos engineering really shines in this scenario. Instead of running an experiment once, we can run it continuously to detect any anomalies, experimenting every time on a system in a different state and during the kind of failure we expect to see. Simple yet effective.\nLet’s go back to our example. We have a 1-minute deadline to start a new service. Let’s automate an ongoing experiment that starts a new service every few minutes, measures the time it took to become available, and alerts if it exceeds a certain threshold. That threshold will be our internal SLO, which is more aggressive than the legally binding version in the SLA that we signed, so that we can get alerted when we get close to trouble.\nIt’s a common scenario, so let’s take our time and make it real.\n11.2.1 Experiment 3: verify pods are ready within (n) seconds of being created\nChances are, that PaaS you’re building is running on Kubernetes. When your client makes a request to your system, it translates into a request for Kubernetes to create a new deployment. You can acknowledge the request to your client, but this is where things start getting tricky. How do you know that the service is ready? In one of the previous experiments we used kubectl get pods --watch to print to the console all changes to the state of the pods we cared about. All of them are happening asynchronously, in the background, while Kubernetes is trying to converge to the desired state. In Kubernetes, pods can be in one of the following states:\n\npending - the pod has been accepted by Kubernetes, but it’s not been setup yet\nrunning - the pod has been setup, and at least one container is still running\nsucceeded - all containers in the pod have terminated in success\nfailed - all containers in the pod have terminated, at least one of them in failure\nunknown - the state of the pod is unknown (typically the node running it stopped reporting its state to Kubernetes)\n\nIf everything goes well, the happy path is for a pod to start in pending, and then move to running. But before that happens, a lot of things need to happen, many of which will take a different amount of time every time, for example:\n\nimage download - unless already present on the host, the images for each container need to be downloaded, potentially from a remote location. Depending on the size of the image and on how busy the location from which it needs to be downloaded is at the time, it might take a different amount of time every time. Additionally, like everything on the network, it’s prone to failure and might need to be retried.\npreparing dependencies - before a pod is actually run, Kubernetes might need to prepare some dependencies it relies on, like (potentially large) volumes, configuration files and so on\nactually running the containers - the time to actually start a container will vary, depending on how busy the host machine is\n\nIn a not-so-happy path, for example, if an image download gets interrupted, you might end up with a pod going from pending through failed to running. The point is that it can’t easily be predicted how long it’s going to take to actually have it running. So the next best thing we can do is to continuously test it and alert when it gets too close to the threshold we care about.\nWith PowerfulSeal, it’s very easy to do. We can write a policy that will deploy some example application to run on the cluster, wait the time we expect it to take, and then execute an HTTP request to verify that the application is running correctly. It can also automatically clean the application up when it’s done, and provide means to get alerted when the experiment failed.\nNormally, we would add some type of failure, and test that the system withstands that. But right now I just want to illustrate the idea of ongoing experiments, so let’s keep it simple and stick to just verifying our SLO on the system without any disturbance.\nLeveraging that, we can design the following experiment:\n\nObservability: read PowerfulSeal output (and/or metrics)\nSteady state: N/A\nHypothesis: when I schedule a new pod and a service, it becomes available for HTTP calls within 30 seconds\nRun the experiment!\n\nThat translates into a PowerfulSeal policy that runs indefinitely the following steps:\n\ncreate a pod and a service\nwait 30 seconds\nmake a call to the service to verify it’s available, fail if it’s not\nclean up (remote the pod and service)\nrinse and repeat\n\nTake a look at figure 11.3 that shows this process visually.\nFigure 11.4 Example of an ongoing chaos experiment\n\nTo write the actual PowerfulSeal policy file, we’re going to use three more features:\n\nFirst, a step of type kubectl behaves just like you expect it to: it executes the attached Yaml just like if you did a kubectl apply or kubectl delete. We’ll use that to create the pods in question. We’ll also use the option for automatic clean up at the end of the scenario, called autoDelete.\nSecond, we’ll use the wait feature to wait for the 30 seconds we expect to be sufficient to deploy and start the pod.\nThird, we’ll use the probeHTTP to make an HTTP request and detect whether it works. probeHTTP is fairly flexible; it supports calling services or arbitrary urls, using proxies and more.\n\nWe’ll also need an actual test app to deploy and call. Ideally, we’d choose something that represents a reasonable approximation of the type of software that the platform is supposed to handle. To keep things simple, we can deploy a simple version of Goldpinger again. It has an endpoint /healthz that we can reach to confirm that it started correctly.\nListing 11.4 shows experiment3.yml, which is what the preceding list looks like when translated into a Yaml file. Note, that unlike in the previous experiments, where we configured the policy to only run once, here we configure it to run continuously (the default) with a 5- to 10-second wait in between runs. Take a look - we’re going to run that file in just a second.\nListing 11.4 PowerfulSeal scenario implementing experiment 3 (experiment3.yml)\nconfig:\n  runStrategy:\n    minSecondsBetweenRuns: 5             #A\n    maxSecondsBetweenRuns: 10\nscenarios:\n- name: Verify pod start SLO\n  steps:\n  - kubectl:                             #B\n      autoDelete: true                   #C\n      # equivalent to `kubectl apply -f -`\n      action: apply\n      payload: |\n        ---\n        apiVersion: v1\n        kind: Pod\n        metadata:\n          name: slo-test\n          labels:\n            app: slo-test\n        spec:\n          containers:\n          - name: goldpinger\n            image: docker.io/bloomberg/goldpinger:v3.0.0\n            env:\n            - name: HOST\n              value: \"0.0.0.0\"\n            - name: PORT\n              value: \"8080\"\n            ports:\n            - containerPort: 8080\n              name: goldpinger\n        ---\n        apiVersion: v1\n        kind: Service\n        metadata:\n          name: slo-test\n        spec:\n          type: LoadBalancer\n          ports:\n            - port: 8080\n              name: goldpinger\n          selector:\n            app: slo-test\n  # wait the minimal time for the SLO\n  - wait:                                #D\n      seconds: 30\n  # make sure the service responds\n  - probeHTTP:\n      target:\n        service:                         #E\n          name: slo-test\n          namespace: default\n          port: 8080\n      endpoint: /healthz                #F\n\n#A configure the seal to run continuously with 5-10 wait between runs\n#B the kubectl command is equivalent to kubectl apply -f\n#C clean up whatever was created here at the end of th scenario\n#D wait for the arbitrarily chosen 30 seconds\n#E make an HTTP call to the specified service (the one created above in kubectl section)\n#F call the /healthz endpoint just to verify the server is up and running\nWe’re almost ready to run this experiment, but have just one caveat to get out of the way. If you’re running this on Minikube, the service IPs that PowerfulSeal uses to make the call in probeHTTP need to be accessible from your local machine. Fortunately, that can be handled by the Minikube binary. To make them accessible, run the following command in a terminal window (it will ask for a sudo password):\nminikube tunnel\nAfter a few seconds, you will see it start to periodically print a confirmation message similar to the following. This is to show you that it detected a service, and that it made local routing changes to your machine to make the IP route correctly. When you stop the process, the changes will be undone:\nStatus: \n          machine: minikube \n          pid: 10091 \n          route: 10.96.0.0/12 -> 192.168.99.100 \n          minikube: Running \n          services: [goldpinger] \n      errors:  \n                  minikube: no errors \n                  router: no errors \n                  loadbalancer emulator: no errors\nWith that, we are ready to run the experiment. Once again, to have a good view of what’s happening to the cluster, let’s start a terminal window and run the kubectl command to watch for changes:\nkubectl get pods --watch\nIn another window, let’s run the actual experiment. You can do that by running the following command:\npowerfulseal autonomous --policy-file experiment3.yml\nPowerfulSeal will start running, and you’ll need to stop it at some point with Ctrl-C. A full cycle of running the experiment will look similar to the following output. Note the lines creating the pod, making the call and getting a response and doing the cleanup (all in bold font):\n(...) \n  2020-08-26 09:52:23 INFO scenario.Verify pod star Starting scenario 'Verify pod start SLO' (3 steps) \n  2020-08-26 09:52:23 INFO action_kubectl.Verify pod star pod/slo-test created service/slo-test created \n  2020-08-26 09:52:23 INFO action_kubectl.Verify pod star Return code: 0 \n  2020-08-26 09:52:23 INFO scenario.Verify pod star Sleeping for 30 seconds \n  2020-08-26 09:52:53 INFO action_probe_http.Verify pod star Making a call: http://10.101.237.29:8080/healthz, get, {}, 1000, 200, , , True \n  2020-08-26 09:52:53 INFO action_probe_http.Verify pod star Response: {\"OK\":true,\"duration-ns\":260,\"generated-at\":\"2020-08-26T08:52:53.572Z\"} \n  2020-08-26 09:52:53 INFO scenario.Verify pod star Scenario finished \n  2020-08-26 09:52:53 INFO scenario.Verify pod star Cleanup started (1 items) \n  2020-08-26 09:53:06 INFO action_kubectl.Verify pod star pod \"slo-test\" deleted \n  service \"slo-test\" deleted  2020-08-26 09:53:06 INFO action_kubectl.Verify pod star Return code: 0 \n  2020-08-26 09:53:06 INFO scenario.Verify pod star Cleanup done \n  2020-08-26 09:53:06 INFO policy_runner Sleeping for 8 seconds\nPowerfulSeal says that the SLO was being respected, which is great. But we only just met, so let’s double-check that it actually deployed (and cleaned up) the right stuff on the cluster. To do that, go back to the terminal window running kubectl. You should see the new pod appear, run and disappear, similar to the following output:\nslo-test        0/1     Pending   0          0s \nslo-test        0/1     Pending   0          0s \nslo-test        0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s \nslo-test        1/1     Running             0          1s \nslo-test        1/1     Terminating         0          30s \nslo-test        0/1     Terminating         0          31s\nSo there you have it. With about 50 lines of verbose Yaml, you can describe an ongoing experiment and detect when starting a pod takes longer than 30 seconds. The Goldpinger image is pretty small, so in the real world, you’d pick something that more closely resembles the type of thing that will run on the platform. You could also run multiple scenarios for multiple types of images you expect to deal with. And if you wanted to make sure that the image is downloaded every time, so that you deal with the worst-case scenario, that can easily be achieved by specifying imagePullPolicy: Always in your pod’s template (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/#container-images).\nThis should give you an idea of what an ongoing, continuously verified experiment can do for you. You can build on that to test other things, including but not limited to the following:\n\nSLOs around pod healing. If you kill a pod, how long does it take to be rescheduled and ready again?\nSLOs around scaling. If you scale your deployment, how long does it take for the new pods to become available?\n\nAs I write this, the weather outside is changing, it’s getting a little bit… cloudy. Let’s take a look at that now.\nNOTE POP QUIZ: WHEN DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO RUN CHAOS EXPERIMENTS CONTINUOUSLY?\nPick one:\n\nWhen you want to detect when an SLO is not satisfied\nWhen an absence of problems doesn’t prove that the system works well\nWhen you want to introduce an element of randomness\nWhen you want to make sure that there are no regressions in the new version of the system\nAll of the above\n\nSee appendix B for answers.\n\n"},"docs/Cloud_layer.html":{"url":"docs/Cloud_layer.html","title":"11.3 Cloud layer","keywords":"","body":"11.3 Cloud layer\nSo far we’ve focused on introducing failure to particular pods running on a Kubernetes cluster -- a bit like a reverse surgical procedure, inserting a problem with high precision. And the ease with which Kubernetes allows us to do that is still making me feel warm and fuzzy inside to this day.\nBut there is more. If you’re running your cluster in a cloud, private or public, it’s easy to simulate failure on the VM level, by simply taking them up or down. In Kubernetes, a lot of the time you can stop thinking about the machines and data centers that your clusters are built on. But it doesn’t mean that they stop existing. They are very much still there, and you still need to obey the rules of physics governing their behavior. And with bigger scale come bigger problems. Let me show you some napkin maths to explain what I mean.\nOne of the metrics to express the reliability of a piece of hardware is the Mean Time To Failure (MTTF). It’s the average time that the said hardware runs without failure. It’s typically established empirically by looking at historical data. For example, let’s say that the servers in your datacenter are of good quality, and you have a MTTF time of 5 years. That means that on average, each server will run about 5 years between times it fails. Roughly speaking, on any given day, the chance of failing for each of your servers is 1 in 1826 (5*365 + leap year). That’s 0.05% chance. This is of course a simplification and there are other factors that would need to be taken into account for a serious probability calculation, but this is a good enough estimate for our needs.\nNow, depending on your scale you’re going to be more or less exposed to that. If the failures were truly independent in a mathematical sense, with just 20 servers you’d have a daily chance of failure of 1%, or 10% with 200 servers. And if that failed server is running multiple VMs that you use as Kubernetes nodes, you’re going to end up with a chunk of your cluster down. If your scale is in the thousands of servers, the failure is just a daily occurrence.\nFrom a perspective of a chaos-engineering practicing site-reliability engineering (SRE), that means one thing: you should test your system for the kind of failure coming from hardware failure:\n\nsingle machines going down and back up\ngroups of machines going down and back up\nentire regions/datacenters/zones going down and back up\nnetwork partitions that make it look like other machines are unavailable\n\nLet’s take a look at how we can prepare against this kind of issue.\n11.3.1 Cloud provider APIs, availability zones\nEvery cloud provider offers an API you can use to create and modify VMs, including taking them up and down. This includes self-hosted, open-source solutions like OpenStack. They also provide GUIs, CLIs, and libraries and more to integrate best with your existing workflow.\nTo allow for effective planning against outages, they also structure their hardware by partitioning it using regions (or equivalent) and then again using availability zones (or equivalent) inside of the regions. Why is that?\nTypically, regions represent different physical locations, often far away from each other, plugged into separate utilities providers (internet, electricity, water, cooling, and so on). This is to make sure that if something dramatic happens in one region (storm, earthquake, flood), other regions remain unaffected. It limits the blast radius to a single region.\nAvailability zones are there to further limit that blast radius within a single region. The actual implementations vary, but the idea is to leverage things that are redundant (power supply, internet provider, networking hardware) to put the machines that rely on them in separate groups. For example, if your datacenter has two racks of servers, each plugged into a separate power supply and separate internet supply, you could mark each rack as an availability zone, because failure within the components in one zone won’t affect the other. An example of both regions and availability zones is shown in figure 11.4. The region West Coast has two availability zones (W1 and W2), each running two machines. Similarly, the East Coast region has two availability zones (E1 and E2), each running two machines. A failure of a region wipes out four machines. A failure of an availability zone wipes out two.\nFigure 11.5 Regions and availability zones\n\nWith this partitioning, software engineers can design their applications to be resilient to the different problems we mentioned earlier:\n\nspreading your application across multiple regions can make it immune to an entire region going down\nwithin a region, spreading your application across multiple availability zones can help make it immune to an availability zone going down\n\nTo automatically achieve this kind of spreading, we often talk about affinity and anti-affinity. Marking two machines with the same affinity group simply means that they should (soft affinity) or must (hard affinity) be running within the same partition (availability zone, region, others). Anti-affinity is the opposite: items within the same group shouldn’t or mustn't be running in the same partition.\nAnd to make planning easier, the cloud providers often express their SLOs using regions and availability zones -- for example, promising to keep each region up 95% of the time, but at least one region up 99.99% of the time.\nLet’s see how you’d go about implementing an on-demand outage to verify your application.\n11.3.2 Experiment 4: taking VMs down\nOn Kubernetes, the application you deploy is going to be run on some physical machine somewhere. Most of the time you don’t care which one that is - until you want to ensure a reasonable partitioning in respect to outages. To make sure that multiple replicas of the same application aren’t running on the same availability zones, most Kubernetes providers set labels for each node that can be used for anti-affinity. Kubernetes also allows you to set your own criteria of anti-affinity and will try to schedule pods in a way that respects them.\nLet’s assume that you have a reasonable spread, and that you want to see that your application survives the loss of some set of machines. We can take the example of Goldpinger from the previous section. In a real cluster, we would be running an instance per node. Earlier we killed a pod, and we investigated how that was being detected by its peers. Another way of going about that would be to take down a VM and see how the system reacts. Will it be detected as quickly? Will the instance be rescheduled somewhere else? How long will it take for it to recover, once the VM is brought back up? These are all questions we could investigate using this technique.\nFrom the implementation perspective, these experiments can be very simple. In its most crude form, you can log into a GUI, select the machines in question on a list and click Shutdown or write a simple bash script that uses the CLI for a particular cloud. It would absolutely do it.\nThe only problem with these two approaches is that they are cloud-provider specific, and you might end up reinventing the wheel each time. If only there was an open-source solution supporting all major clouds that let you do that. Oh wait, PowerfulSeal can do that! Let me show you how to use it.\nPowerfulSeal supports OpenStack, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and adding a new driver involves implementing a single class with a handful of methods. To make PowerfulSeal take VMs down and bring them back up, you’re going to need to do the two following things:\n\nConfigure the relevant cloud driver (see powerfulseal autonomous --help)\nWrite a policy file that does the VM operations\n\nThe cloud drivers are configured in the same way that their respective CLIs are. Unfortunately, our Minikube setup has only a single VM, so it won’t be any good for this section. Let me give you two examples of two different ways of taking VMs down.\nFirst, similar to podAction, which we used in the previous experiments, we can use nodeAction. It works the same way: it matches, filters and actions on a set of nodes. You can match on names, IP addresses, availability zones, groups, and state. Take a look at listing 11.5, which represents an example policy for taking down a single node from any availability zone starting with “WEST”, then making an example HTTP request to verify that things continue working, and finally cleaning up after itself by restarting the node.\nListing 11.5 PowerfulSeal scenario implementing experiment 4a (experiment4a.yml)\nconfig:\n  runStrategy:\n    runs: 1\nscenarios:\n- name: Test load-balancing on master nodes\n  steps:\n  - nodeAction:\n      matches:\n        - property:\n            name: \"az\"                    #A\n            value: \"WEST.*\"\n      filters:\n        - randomSample:\n            size: 1                       #B\n      actions:\n        - stop:                           #C\nautoRestart: true\n  - probeHTTP:                            #D\n      target:\n        url: \"http://load-balancer.example.com\"\n\n#A select one VM from any availability zone starting with WEST\n#B select one VM randomly from within the matched set\n#C stop the VM, but auto-restart it at the end of the scenario\n#D make a HTTP request to some kind of URL to confirm that the system keeps working\nSecond, you can also stop VMs running a particular pod. This can be done using podAction to select the pod, and then using stopHost action to stop the node that the pod is running on. Listing 11.6 shows an example of how you can achieve that. It selects a random pod from namespace “mynamespace”, and stops the VM that runs it. When it’s done, it automatically restarts it.\nListing 11.6 PowerfulSeal scenario implementing experiment 4b (experiment4b.yml)\nscenarios:\n- name: Stop that host!\n  steps:\n  - podAction:\n      matches:\n        - namespace: mynamespace          #A\n      filters:\n        - randomSample:                   #B\n            size: 1\n      actions:\n        - stopHost:                       #C\nautoRestart: true\n\n#A select all pods in namespace “mynamespace”\n#B select one pod randomly from within the matched set\n#C stop the VM, but auto-restart it at the end of the scenario\nBoth of these policy files work with any of the supported cloud providers. And if you’d like to add another cloud provider, feel free to send pull requests on github to https://github.com/powerfulseal/powerfulseal!\nTime to wrap this section up. Hopefully that gives you enough tools and ideas to go forth and improve your cloud-based applications’ reliability.

And it’s for a good reason; it solves a whole lot of problems that come from running a large number of applications on large clusters. But like everything else in life, it comes with some costs. One of them is the complexity of the underlying workings of Kubernetes. And although this can be somewhat alleviated by using managed Kubernetes clusters, where most of it is someone else’s problem, you’re never fully insulated from the consequences. And perhaps you’re reading this on your way to a job managing Kubernetes clusters, which is yet another reason to understand how things work.\nRegardless of whose problem this is, it’s good to know how Kubernetes works under the hood and how to test it works well. And as you’re about to see, chaos engineering fits neatly right in.\nNOTE \nKEEPING UP WITH THE KUBERNETIANS\nIn this section, I’m going to describe things as they stand for Kubernetes v1.18.3. Kubernetes is a fast-moving target, so even though special care was taken to keep the details in this section as future-proof as possible, things change quickly in Kubernetes Land.\n\nLet’s start at the beginning - with the control plane.\n12.1.1 Control plane\nKubernetes control plane is the brain of the cluster. It consists of the following components:\n\netcd - the database storing all the information about the cluster\nkube-apiserver - the server through which all interactions with the cluster are done, and that stores information in etcd\nkube-controller-manager - implements the infinite loop reading the current state, and attempting to modify it to converge into the desired state\nkube-scheduler - detects newly created pods and assigns them to nodes, taking into account various constraints (affinity, resource requirements, policies, etc)\nkube-cloud-manager (optional) - controls cloud-specific resources (VMs, routing)\n\nIn the previous chapter, we created a deployment for Goldpinger. Let’s see, on a high level, what happens under the hood in the control plane when you run a kubectl apply command. First, your request reaches the kube-apiserver of your cluster. The server validates the request and stores the new or modified resources in etcd. In our case, it creates a new deployment resource. Once that’s done, kube-controller-manager gets notified of the new deployment. It reads the current state to see what needs to be done, and eventually creates new pods through another call to kube-apiserver. Once the kube-apiserver stores it in etcd, the kube-scheduler gets notified about the new pods, picks the best node to run them, assigns the node to them, and updates them back in kube-apiserver. As you can see, the kube-apiserver is at the center of it all, and all the logic is implemented in asynchronous, eventually consistent loops in loosely connected components. See figure 12.1 for a graphic representation.\nFigure 12.1 Kubernetes control plane interactions when creating a deployment\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each of these components and see their strengths and weaknesses, starting with etcd.\netcd\nLegend has it that etcd (https://etcd.io/) was first written by an intern at a company called CoreOS that was bought by Red Hat that was acquired by IBM. Talk about bigger fish eating smaller fish. If the legend is to be believed, it was an exercise in implementing a distributed consensus algorithm called Raft (https://raft.github.io/). What does consensus have to do with etcd?\nFour words: availability and fault tolerance. Earlier in this chapter, we spoke about mean time to failure (MTTF) and how with just 20 servers, you were playing Russian roulette with 0.05% probability of losing your data every day. If you have only a single copy of the data, when it’s gone it’s gone. We want a system that’s immune to that. That’s fault tolerance.\nSimilarly, if you have a single server, if it’s down your system is down. We want a system that’s immune to that. That’s availability.\nIn order to achieve fault tolerance and availability, there isn’t really much else that you can do other than run multiple copies. And that’s where you run into trouble: the multiple copies have to somehow agree on a version of reality. In other words, they need to reach a consensus.\nConsensus is agreeing on watching a movie on Netflix. If you’re by yourself, there is no one to argue with. When you’re with your partner, it becomes almost impossible, because neither of you can gather a majority for a particular choice. That’s when power moves and barter comes into play. But if you add a third person, then whoever convinces them gains a majority and wins the argument.\nThat’s pretty much exactly how Raft (and by extension, etcd) works. Instead of running a single etcd instance, you run a cluster with an odd number of nodes (typically three or five) and then the instances use the consensus algorithm to decide on the leader who basically makes all decisions while in power. If the leader stops responding (Raft uses a system of heartbeats, or regular calls between all instances, to detect that), a new election begins where everyone announces their candidacy, votes for themselves, and waits for other votes to come in. Whoever gets a majority of votes assumes power. The best thing about Raft is that it’s relatively easy to understand. The second best thing about Raft is that it works.\nIf you'd like to see the algorithm in action, their official website has a very nice animation with heartbeats represented as little balls flying between bigger balls representing nodes (https://raft.github.io/). I took a screenshot showing a five-node-cluster (S1 to S5) in figure 12.2. It’s also interactive, so you can take nodes down and see how the rest of the system copes.\nFigure 12.2 Animation showing Raft consensus algorithm in action (https://raft.github.io/)\n\nI could talk (and I have talked) about etcd and Raft all day, but let’s focus on what’s important from the chaos engineering perspective. Etcd holds pretty much all of the data about a Kubernetes cluster. It’s strongly consistent, meaning that the data you write to etcd is replicated to all nodes, and regardless of which node you connect to, you get the up-to-date data. The price you pay for that is in performance. Typically you’ll be running in clusters of three or five nodes, because that tends to give enough fault tolerance and any extra nodes just slow the cluster down with little benefit. And odd numbers of members are better, because they actually decrease fault tolerance.\nTake a three-node cluster for example. To achieve a quorum, you need a majority of two nodes (n/2+1 = 3/2+1 = 2). Or looking at it from the availability perspective, you can lose a single node and your cluster keeps working. Now, if you add an extra node for a total of four, now you need a majority of three to function. That means that you still can survive only a single node failure at a time, but you now have more nodes in the cluster that can fail, so overall you are worse off in terms of fault tolerance.\nRunning etcd reliably is not easy. It requires an understanding of your hardware profiles, tweaking various parameters accordingly, continuous monitoring, and keeping up to date with bug fixes and improvements in etcd itself. It also requires building an understanding of what actually happens when failure occurs and whether the cluster heals correctly. And that’s where chaos engineering can really shine. The way that etcd is run varies from one Kubernetes offering to another, so the details will vary too, but here are a few high-level ideas:\n\nExperiment 1: in a three-node cluster take down a single etcd instance\nDoes kubectl still work? Can you schedule, modify and scale new pods?\nDo you see any failures connecting to etcd? Etcd clients are expected to retry their requests to another instance, if the one they connected to doesn’t respond\nWhen you take the node back up, does the etcd cluster recover? How long does it take?\nCan you see the new leader election and small increase in traffic in your monitoring setup?\n\n\nExperiment 2: restrict resources (CPU) available to an etcd instance to simulate an unusually high load on the machine running the instance\nDoes the cluster still work?\nDoes the cluster slow down? By how much?\n\n\nExperiment 3: add a networking delay to a single etcd instance\nDoes a single slow instance affect the overall performance?\nCan you see the slowness in your monitoring setup? Will you be alerted if that happens? Does your dashboard show how close the values are to the limits (the values causing timeouts)?\n\n\nExperiment 4: take down enough nodes for the etcd cluster to lose quorum\nDoes kubectl still work?\nDo the pods already on the cluster keep running?\nDoes healing work?\nIf you kill a pod, is it restarted?\nIf you delete a pod managed by a deployment, will a new pod be created?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis book gives you all the tools you need to implement all of these experiments and more. Etcd is the memory of your cluster, so it’s crucial to test it well. And if you’re using a managed Kubernetes offering, you’re trusting that the people responsible for running your clusters know the answers to all these questions (and that they can prove it with experimental data). Ask them. If they’re taking your money, they should be able to give you reasonable answers!\nHopefully that’s enough for a primer on etcd. Let’s pull the thread a little bit more and look at the only thing actually speaking to etcd in your cluster - the kube-apiserver.\nkube-apiserver\nThe kube-apiserver, true to its name, provides a set of APIs to read and modify the state of your cluster. Every component interacting with the cluster does so through the kube-apiserver. For availability reasons, kube-apiserver also needs to be run in multiple copies. But because all the state is stored in etcd and etcd takes care of its consistency, kube-apiserver can be stateless. That means that running it is much simpler, and as long as there are enough instances running to handle the load of requests, we’re good. There is no need to worry about majorities or anything like that. It also means that they can be load-balanced, although some internal components are often configured to skip the load balancer. Figure 12.3 shows what this typically looks like.\nFigure 12.3 Etcd and kube-apiserver\n\nFrom the chaos engineering perspective, you might be interested in knowing how slowness on the kube-apiserver affects the overall performance of the cluster. Here are a few ideas:\n\nExperiment 1: create traffic to the kube-apiserver\nSince everything, including the internal components responsible for creating, updating and scheduling resources, talks to kube-apiserver, creating enough traffic to keep it busy could affect how the cluster behaves.\n\n\nExperiment 2: add network slowness\nSimilarly, adding a networking delay in front of the proxy could lead to build up of queuing of new requests and adversely affect the cluster.\n\n\n\nOverall, you will find kube-apiserver start up quickly and perform pretty well. Despite the amount of work that it does, running it is pretty lightweight. Next in the line, the kube-controller-manager.\nkube-controller-manager\nKube-controller-manager implements the infinite control loop, continuously detecting changes in the cluster state and reacting to them to move it toward the desired state. You can think of it as a collection of loops, each handling a particular type of resource.\nDo you remember when you created a deployment with kubectl in the previous chapter? What actually happened is that kubectl connected to an instance of kube-apiserver and requested creation of a new resource of type deployment. That was picked up by kube-controller-manager, which in turn created a ReplicaSet. The purpose of the latter is to manage a set of pods, ensuring that the desired number runs on the cluster. How is it done? You guessed it: a replica set controller (part of kube-controller-manager) picks it up and creates pods. Both the notification mechanism (called watch in Kubernetes) and the updates are served by the kube-apiserver. See figure 12.4 for a graphical representation. A similar cascade happens when a deployment is updated or deleted; the corresponding controllers get notified about the change and do their bit.\nFigure 12.4 Kubernetes control plane interactions when creating a deployment - more details\n\nThis loosely coupled setup allows for separation of responsibilities; each controller does only one thing. It is also the heart of Kubernetes’ ability to heal from failure. Any discrepancies from the desired state will be attempted to be corrected ad infinitum.\nLike kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager is typically run in multiple copies for failure resilience. Unlike kube-apiserver, only one of the copies is actually doing work at a time. The instances agree between themselves on who the leader is through acquiring a lease in etcd.\nHow does that work? Thanks to its property of strong consistency, etcd can be used as a leader-election mechanism. In fact, its API allows for acquiring what they call a lock - a distributed mutex with an expiration date. Let’s say that you run three instances of the kube-controller manager. If all three try to acquire the lease simultaneously, only one will succeed. The lease then needs to be renewed before it expires. If the leader stops working or disappears, the lease will expire and another copy will acquire it. Once again, etcd comes in handy and allows for offloading a difficult problem (leader election) and keeping the component relatively simple.\nFrom the chaos engineering perspective, here are some ideas of experiments:\n\nExperiment 1: how busy your kube-apiserver is may affect the speed at which your cluster converges towards the desired state\nKube-controller-manager gets all its information about the cluster from kube-apiserver. It’s worth understanding how any extra traffic on kube-apiserver affects the speed at which your cluster is converging towards the desired state. At what point does kube-controller-manager start timing out, rendering the cluster broken?\n\n\nExperiment 2: how your lease expiry affects how quickly the cluster recovers from losing the leader instance of kube-controller-manager\nIf you run your own Kubernetes cluster, you can choose various timeouts for this component. That includes the expiry time of the leadership lease. A shorter value will increase speed at which the cluster restarts converging towards the desired state after losing the leader kube-controller-manager, but it comes at a price of increased load on kube-apiserver and etcd. A larger value\n\n\n\nWhen kube-controller-manager is done reacting to the new deployment, the pods are created, but they aren’t scheduled anywhere. That’s where kube-scheduler comes in.\nkube-scheduler\nLike we mentioned earlier, kube-scheduler’s job is to detect pods that haven’t been scheduled on any nodes, and find them a new home. It might be brand new pods, or it might be that a node that used to run the pod went down and a replacement is needed.\nEvery time the kube-scheduler assigns a pod to run on a particular node in the cluster, it tries to find a best fit. Finding the best fit consists of two steps:\n\nfilter out the nodes that don’t satisfy the pod’s requirements\nrank the remaining nodes by a giving them scores based on a predefined list of priorities\n\nINFO\nIf you’d like to know the details of the algorithm used by the latest version of the kube-scheduler, you can see it in https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-scheduling/scheduler_algorithm.md.\n\nFor a quick overview, the filters include:\n\ncheck that the resources (CPU, RAM, disk) requested by the pod can fit in the node\ncheck that any ports requested on the host are available on the node\ncheck if the pod is supposed to run on a node with a particular hostname\ncheck that the affinity (or anti-affinity) requested by the pod matches (or doesn’t match) the node\ncheck that the node is not under memory or disk pressure\n\nThe priorities taken into account when ranking nodes include:\n\nthe highest amount of free resources after scheduling (the higher the better - this has the effect of enforcing spreading)\nbalance between the CPU and memory utilization (the more balanced the better)\nanti-affinity - nodes matching the anti-affinity setting are least preferred\nimage locality - nodes already having the image are preferred (this has the effect of minimizing the amount of downloads of images)\n\nJust like kube-controller-manager, a cluster typically runs multiple copies of kube-scheduler but only the leader actually does the scheduling at any given time. From the chaos engineering perspective, this component is prone to basically the same issues as the kube-controller-manager.\nFrom the moment you ran the kubectl apply command, the components you just saw worked together to figure out how to move your cluster towards the new state you requested (the state with a new deployment). At the end of that process, the new pods were scheduled, assigned a node to run. But so far, we haven’t seen the actual component that starts the newly scheduled process. Time to take a look at Kubelet.\nNOTE \nPOP QUIZ: WHERE IS THE CLUSTER DATA STORED?\nPick one:\n\nSpread across the various components on the cluster\nIn /var/kubernetes/state.json\nIn etcd\nIn the cloud, uploaded using the latest AI and machine learning algorithms and leveraging the revolutionary power of blockchain technology\n\nSee appendix B for answers.\n\nNOTE \nPOP QUIZ: WHAT’S THE CONTROL PLANE IN KUBERNETES JARGON?\nPick one:\n\nThe set of components implementing the logic of Kubernetes converging towards the desired state\nA remote control aircraft, used in Kubernetes commercials\nA name for Kubelet and Docker\n\nSee appendix B for answers.\n\n12.1.2  Kubelet and pause container\nKubelet is the agent starting and stopping containers on a host to implement the pods you requested. Running a Kubelet daemon on a computer turns it into a part of a Kubernetes cluster. Don’t be fooled by the affectionate name; Kubelet is a real workhorse, doing the dirty work ordered by the control plane. Like everything else on a cluster, it reads the state and takes its orders from the kube-apiserver. It also reports the data about the factual state of what’s running on the node, whether it’s running or crashing, how much CPU and RAM is actually used, and more. That data is later leveraged by the control plane to make decisions and make it available to the user.\nTo illustrate how Kubelet works, let’s do a thought experiment. Let’s say that the deployment we created earlier always crashes within seconds after it starts. The pod is scheduled to be running on a particular node. The Kubelet daemon is notified about the new pod. First, it downloads the requested image. Then, it creates a new container with that image and the specified configuration. In fact, it creates two containers - the one we requested, and another special one called pause. What is the purpose of the pause container?\nIt’s a pretty neat hack. In Kubernetes, the unit of software is a pod, not a single container. Containers inside a pod need to share certain resources and not others. For example, processes in two containers inside a single pod share the same IP address and can communicate via localhost. Do you remember namespaces from the chapter on Docker? The IP address-sharing is implemented by sharing the network namespace. But other things, like for example the CPU limit, are applicable to each container separately. The reason for pause to exist is simply to hold these resources while the other containers might be crashing and coming back up. The pause container doesn’t do much. It starts and immediately goes to sleep. The name is pretty fitting.\nOnce the container is up, Kubelet will monitor it. If it crashes, it will bring it back up. See figure 12.5 for a graphical representation of the whole process.\nFigure 12.5 Kubelet starting a new pod\n\nWhen we delete the pod, or perhaps it gets rescheduled somewhere else, Kubelet takes care of removing the relevant containers. Without Kubelet, all the resources created and scheduled by the control plane would remain abstract concepts.\nThis also makes Kubelet a single point of failure. If it crashes, for whatever reason, , no changes will be made to the containers running on that node, even though Kubernetes will happily accept your changes. They just won’t ever get implemented on that node.\nFrom the perspective of chaos engineering, it’s important to understand what actually happens to the cluster if Kubelet stops working. Here are a few ideas:\n\nExperiment 1: after Kubelet dies, how long does it take for pods to get rescheduled somewhere else?\n\nWhen Kubelet stops reporting its readiness to the control plane, after a certain timeout, it’s marked as unavailable (NotReady). That timeout is configurable and defaults to 5 minutes at the time of writing. Pods are not immediately removed from that node. The control plane will wait another configurable timeout before it starts assigning the pods to another node.\nIn a scenario where a node disappears (for example, the hypervisor running the VM crashes), this means that you’re going to need to wait a certain minimal amount of time for the pods to start running somewhere else.\nIf the pod is still running, but for some reason Kubelet can’t connect to the control plane (network partition) or dies, then you’re going to end up with a node running whatever it was running before the event, and it won’t get any updates. One of the possible side-effects is to run extra copies of your software with potentially stale configuration.\nWe’ve covered the tools to take VMs up and down in the previous chapter, as well as killing processes. PowerfulSeal also supports executing commands over SSH, for example to kill or switch off Kubelet.\n\n\nExperiment 2: does Kubelet restart correctly after crashing?\n\nKubelet typically runs directly on the host to minimise the number of dependencies. If it crashes, it should be restarted.\nAs we saw in chapter 2, sometimes setting things up to get restarted is harder than it initially looks, so it’s worth checking that different patterns of crashing (consecutive crashes, time-spaced crashes, and so on) are all covered. This takes little time and can avoid pretty bad outages.\n\n\n\nSo the question now remains: how exactly does Kubelet run these containers? Let’s take a look at that now.\nNOTE \nPOP QUIZ: WHICH COMPONENT ACTUALLY STARTS AND STOPS PROCESSES ON THE HOST?\nPick one:\n\nkube-apiserver\netcd\nkubelet\ndocker\n\nSee appendix B for answers.\n\n12.1.3 Kubernetes, Docker, and container runtimes\nKubelet leverages lower-level software to start and stop containers to implement the pods that you ask it to create. This lower-level software is often called container runtimes. In chapter 5, we covered Linux containers and Docker (their most popular representative), and that’s for a good reason. Initially, Kubernetes was written to use Docker directly, and you can still see some naming that matches one-to-one to Docker; even the kubectl CLI feels similar to the Docker CLI.\nToday, Docker is still one of the most popular container runtimes to use with Kubernetes, but it’s by no means the only option. Initially, the support for new runtimes was baked directly into Kubernetes internals. In order to make it easier to add new supported container runtimes, a new API was introduced to standardize the interface between Kubernetes and container runtimes. It is called container runtime interface (CRI) and you can read more about how they introduced it in Kubernetes 1.5 in 2016 at https://kubernetes.io/blog/2016/12/container-runtime-interface-cri-in-kubernetes/.\nThanks to that new interface, interesting things happened. For example, since version 1.14, Kubernetes has had Windows support, where it uses Windows containers (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/) to start and stop containers on machines running Windows. And on Linux, other options have emerged; for example, the following runtimes leverage basically the same set of underlying technologies as Docker:\n\ncontainerd (https://containerd.io/) - the emerging industry standard that seems poised to eventually replace Docker. To make matters more confusing, Docker versions >= 1.11.0 actually use containerd under the hood to run containers\nCRI-O (https://cri-o.io/) - aims to provide a simple, lightweight container runtime optimized for use with Kubernetes\nrkt (https://coreos.com/rkt) - initially developed by CoreOS, the project now appears to be no longer maintained. It was pronounced “rocket”.\n\nTo further the confusion, the ecosystem has some more surprises for you. First, both containerd (and therefore Docker, which relies on it) and CRIO-O share some code by leveraging another open-source project called runC (https://github.com/opencontainers/runc), which manages the lower-level aspects of running a Linux container. Visually, when you stack the blocks on top of one another, it looks like figure 12.6. The user requests a pod, Kubernetes reaches out to the container runtime it was configured with. It might go to Docker, Containerd, or CRI-O, but at the end of the day it all ends up using runC.\nFigure 12.6 Container Runtime Interface, Docker, Containerd, CRI-O and runC.\n\nThe second surprise is that in order to avoid having different standards pushed by different entities, a bunch of companies led by Docker came together to form the Open Container Initiative (or OCI for short https://opencontainers.org/). It provides two specifications:\n\nthe Runtime Specification that describes how to run a filesystem bundle (new term to describe what used to be called a Docker image downloaded and unpacked)\nthe Image Specification that describes what an OCI Image (new term for Docker image) looks like, how to build, upload, and download one\n\nAs you might imagine, most people didn’t just stop using names like Docker images and start prepending everything with OCI, so things can get a little bit confusing at times. But that’s all right. At least there is a standard now!\nOne more plot twist. In recent years, we’ve seen a few interesting projects pop up, that implement the CRI, but instead of running Docker-style Linux containers, get creative:\n\nKata Containers (https://katacontainers.io/) - runs “lightweight VMs” instead of containers, that are optimized for speed, to offer a “container-like” experience, but with stronger isolation offered by different hypervisors\nFirecracker (https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker) - runs “microVMs”, also lightweight type of VMs, implemented using Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine). The idea is the same as Kata Containers, with a different implementation.\ngVisor (https://github.com/google/gvisor) - implements container isolation in a different way than Docker-style projects do. It runs a user space kernel that implements a subset of syscalls that it makes available to the processes running inside of the sandbox. It then sets things up to capture the syscalls made by the process and execute them in the user space kernel. Unfortunately, that capture and redirection of syscalls introduce a performance penalty. There are multiple mechanisms you can use to do that, but the default leverages ptrace that we briefly mention in the chapter on syscalls, and so it takes a serious performance hit.\n\nNow, if we plug these into the previous figure, we end up with something along the lines of figure 12.7. Once again, the user requests a pod, and Kubernetes makes a call through the CRI. But this time, depending on which container runtime you are using, the end process might be running in a container or a VM.\nFigure 12.7 RunC-based container runtimes, alongside Kata Containers, FIrecracker and gVisor.\n\nIf you’re running Docker as your container runtime, everything you learned in chapter 5 will be directly applicable to your Kuberentes cluster. If you’re using ContainerD or CRI-O, it will be mostly the same, because they all use the same underlying technologies. GVisor will differ in many aspects, because of the different approach they chose to implement the isolation. If your cluster uses Kata Containers or Firecracker, you’re going to be running VMs rather than containers. This is a fast-changing landscape, so it’s worth following the new developments in this zone. Unfortunately, as much as I love these technologies, we need to wrap up. I strongly encourage you to at least play around with them.\nLet’s take a look at the last piece of the puzzle - the Kubernetes networking model.\nNOTE \nPOP QUIZ: CAN YOU USE A DIFFERENT CONTAINER RUNTIME THAN DOCKER?\nPick one:\n\nIf you’re in the USA, it depends on the state. Some states allow it\nNo, Docker is required for running Kubernetes\nYes, you can use a number of alternative container runtimes, like CRI-O, containerd and others\n\nSee appendix B for answers.\n\n12.1.4 Kubernetes networking\nThere are three parts of Kubernetes networking that you need to understand to be effective as a chaos engineering practitioner:\n\npod-to-pod networking\nservice networking\ningress networking\n\nI’ll walk you through them one by one. Let’s start with pod-to-pod networking.\nPod-to-pod networking\nTo communicate between pods, or have any traffic routed to them, pods need to be able to resolve each other’s IP addresses. When discussing kubelet, we mentioned that the pause container was holding the IP address that was common for the whole pod. But where does this IP address come from, and how does it work?\nThe answer is simple. It’s a made-up IP address that's assigned to the pod by Kubelet when it starts. When configuring a Kubernetes cluster, a certain range of IP addresses is configured, and then subranges are given to every node in the cluster. Kubelet is then aware of that subrange, and when it creates a pod through the CRI, it gives it an IP address from its range. From the perspective of processes running in that pod, they will see that IP address as the address of their networking interface. So far so good.\nUnfortunately, by itself, this doesn’t implement any pod-to-pod networking. It merely attributes a fake IP address to every pod, and then stores it in kube-apiserver.\nKubernetes then expects you to configure the networking independently. In fact, it only gives you two conditions that you need to satisfy, and doesn’t really care how you achieve that (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#the-kubernetes-network-model):\n\nall pods can communicate to all other pods on the cluster directly\nprocesses running on the node can communicate with all pods on that node\n\nThis is typically done with an overlay network (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network), where the nodes in the cluster are configured to route the fake IP addresses between themselves, and deliver them to the right containers.\nOnce again, the interface for dealing with the networking has been standardized. It’s called Container Networking Interface (CNI). At the time of writing, there are 29 different options for implementing the networking layer listed in the official documentation (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#how-to-implement-the-kubernetes-networking-model). To keep things simple, I’m going to show you an example of how one of the most basic works: flannel (https://github.com/coreos/flannel).\nFlannel runs a daemon (flanneld) on each Kubernetes node and agrees on subranges of IP addresses that should be available to each node. It stores that information in etcd. Every instance of the daemon then ensures that the networking is configured to forward packets from different ranges to their respective nodes. On the other end, the receiving flanneld daemon delivers received packets to the right container. The forwarding is done using one of the supported existing backends, for example VXLAN (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Extensible_LAN).\nTo make it easier to understand, let’s walk through a concrete example. Let’s say that your cluster has two nodes, and the overall pod IP address range is 192.168.0.0/16. To keep things simple, let’s say that node A was assigned range 192.168.1.0/24 and node B was assigned range 192.168.2.0/24. And node A has a pod A1, with an address 192.168.1.1 and it wants to send a packet to pod B2, with an address 192.168.2.2 running on node B.\nWhen pod A1 tries to connect to pod B2, the forwarding set up by flannel will match the node IP address range for node B and encapsulate and forward the packets there. On the receiving end, the instance of flannel running on node B will receive the packets, undo the encapsulation, and deliver them to pod B. From the perspective of a pod, our fake IP addresses are as real as anything else. Take a look at figure 12.8 that shows this in a graphical way.\nFigure 12.8 High-level overview of pod networking with flannel\n\nFlannel is pretty bare-bones. There are much more advanced solutions, doing things like allowing for dynamic policies that dictate which pods can talk to what other pods in what circumstances, and much more. But the high-level idea is the same: the pod IP addresses get routed, and there is a daemon running on each node that makes sure that happens. And that daemon will always be a fragile part of the setup.If it stops working, the networking settings will be stale and potentially wrong.\nThat’s the pod networking in a nutshell. There is another set of fake IP addresses in Kubernetes - service IP addresses. Let’s take a look at that now.\nService networking\nAs a reminder, services in Kubernetes give a shared IP address to a set of pods that you can mix and match based on the labels. In our previous example, we had some pods with a label app=goldpinger: the service used that same label to match the pods and give them a single IP address.\nJust like the pod IP addresses, the service IP addresses are completely made-up. They are implemented by a component called kube-proxy, that also runs on each node on your Kubernetes cluster. Kube-proxy watches for changes to the pods matching the particular label, and reconfigures the host to route these fake IP addresses to their respective destinations. They also offer some load-balancing. The single service IP address will resolve to many pod IP addresses, and depending on how kube-proxy is configured, you can load-balance them in different fashions.\nKube-proxy can use multiple backends to implement the networking changes. One of them is to use iptables (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables). We don’t have time to dive into how iptables works, but at the high level, it allows you to write a set of rules that modify the flow of the packets on the machine.\nIn this mode, kube-proxy will create rules that forward the packets to particular pod IP addresses. If there is more than one pod, there will be rules for each pod, with corresponding probabilities. The first rule to match wins. Let’s say that you have a service that resolves to three pods. On a high level, they would look something like this:\n\nif IP == SERVICE_IP, forward to pod A with probability 33%\nif IP == SERVICE_IP, forward to pod B with probability 50%\nif IP == SERVICE_IP, forward to pod C with probability 100%\n\nThis way, on average, the traffic should be routed roughly equally to the three pods.\nThe weakness of this setup is that iptables evaluates all the rules one by one, until it hits a rule that matches. As you can imagine, the pod services and pods you’re running on your cluster, the more rules there will be, and therefore the bigger overhead this will create.\nTo alleviate that problem, kube-proxy can also use IPVS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Virtual_Server), which scales much better for large deployments.\nFrom the chaos engineering perspective, that’s one of the things you need to be aware of. Here are a few ideas for chaos experiments:\n\nExperiment 1: does number of services affect the speed of networking?\nIf you’re using iptables, you will find that just creating a few thousand services (even if they’re empty) will suddenly slow down the networking on all nodes in a significant way. Do you think your cluster shouldn’t be affected by that? You’re one experiment away from checking that.\n\n\nExperiment 2: how good is the load-balancing?\nWith the probability-based load balancing, you might sometimes find interesting results in terms of traffic split. It might be a good idea to verify your assumptions about that.\n\n\nExperiment 3: what happens when kube-proxy is down?\nIf the networking is not updated, it is quite possible to end up with not only stale routing that doesn’t work, but also routing to the wrong service. Can your setup detect when that happens? Would you get alerted, if requests start flowing to the wrong destinations?\n\n\n\nOnce you have a service configured, one last thing that you want to do with it is to make it accessible outside the cluster. That’s what ingresses are designed for. Let’s take a look at that now.\nIngress networking\nHaving the routing work inside of the cluster is great, but the cluster won’t be of much use if you can’t access the software running on it from the outside. That’s where the ingresses come in.\nIn Kubernetes, an ingress is a natively supported resource that effectively describes a set of hosts and the destination service that these hosts should be routed to. For example, an ingress could say that requests for example.com should go to a service called example, in the namespace called mynamespace, and route to port 8080. It’s a first-class citizen, natively supported by Kubernetes API.\nBut once again, creating this kind of resource doesn’t do anything by itself. You need to have an ingress controller installed that will listen on changes to the resources of this kind and implement them. And yes, you guessed it, there are multiple options. As I’m looking at it now, the official docs list 15 options at https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/.\nLet me use the nginx ingress controller (https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) as an example. We saw nginx in the previous chapters. It’s often used as a reverse proxy, receiving traffic and sending it to some kind of server upstream. That’s precisely how it’s used in the ingress controller.\nWhen you deploy it, it runs a pod on each host. Inside of that pod, it runs an instance of nginx, and an extra process that listens to changes on resources of type ingress. Every time a change is detected, it re-generates a config for nginx, and asks nginx to reload it. Nginx then knows which hosts to listen on, and where to proxy the incoming traffic. It’s that simple.\nIt goes without saying, that the ingress controller is typically the single point of entry to the cluster, and so everything that prevents it from working well will deeply affect the cluster. And like any proxy, it’s easy to mess up its parameters. From the chaos engineering perspective, here are some ideas to get you started:\n\nWhat happens when a new ingress is created or modified and a config is reloaded? Are the existing connections dropped? What about corner cases like websockets?\nDoes your proxy have the same timeout as the service it proxies to? If you time out quicker, not only you can have outstanding requests being processed long after the proxy dropped the connection, but the consequent retries might accumulate and take down the target service.\n\nWe could chat about that for a whole day, but this should be enough to get you started with your testing. Unfortunately, all good things come to an end.
