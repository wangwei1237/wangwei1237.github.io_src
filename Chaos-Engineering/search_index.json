Pawlikowski\nMEAP began April 2020  Publication in Spring 2021 (estimated)\nISBN 9781617297755  410 pages (estimated)  printed in black & white\n\n\n\nThis book is like the Swiss Army knife of chaos engineering. If you need to “break” your app, this book will have a tool that will help you with that.\nAlessandro Campeis\n\nAuto engineers test the safety of a car by intentionally crashing it and carefully observing the results. Chaos engineering applies the same principles to software systems. In Chaos Engineering: Site reliability through controlled disruption, you’ll learn to run your applications and infrastructure through a series of tests that simulate real-life failures. You’ll maximize the benefits of chaos engineering by learning to think like a chaos engineer, and how to design the proper experiments to ensure the reliability of your software. With examples that cover a whole spectrum of software, you’ll be ready to run an intensive testing regime on anything from a simple WordPress site to a massive distributed system running on Kubernetes.\nabout the technology\nRather than just looking for code bugs and errors, chaos engineering sees how your software responds to calamity, including partial infrastructure outages, hardware failure, and other major pitfalls that can befall a production system. By observing a system in distress or under attack, chaos engineering ensures the reliability and resiliency of your software—especially for hard-to-test distributed systems with lots of moving parts and little scope for downtime.\nabout the book\nIn Chaos Engineering: Site reliability through controlled disruption you’ll learn to design and execute controlled failure experiments that reveal the hidden problems in your software. Using a toolbox of open source tools, you’ll inject system-shaking failures at every level—from your Docker containers, to your Kubernetes deployment, to the UI. You’ll learn Linux monitoring for observing system metrics and evaluating your results, and even how to apply Chaos Engineering to make your human teams more reliable and resilient to handling failures. Best of all, all tools and examples come with a downloadable Linux VM image, letting you easily experiment without risk to your own systems.\nwhat's inside\nDesign, run and analyze Chaos Engineering experiments\nSee how applications react to a database connections latency\nExperiment with Docker container isolation\nTest software running on Kubernetes and the platform itself\nInject failure into software running in the HVM\nabout the reader\nFor developers with basic knowledge of scripting and Linux.\nabout the author\nMikolaj Pawlikowski has been practicing chaos engineering for four years, beginning with a large distributed Kubernetes-based microservices platform at Bloomberg. He is the creator of the Kubernetes Chaos Engineering tool PowerfulSeal, and the networking visibility tool Goldpinger. He is an active member of the Chaos Engineering community and speaks at numerous conferences.\n"},"docs/Chaos_in_Kubernetes.html":{"url":"docs/Chaos_in_Kubernetes.html","title":"10 Chaos in Kubernetes","keywords":"","body":"10 Chaos in Kubernetes\nThis chapter covers:\n\nQuick introduction to Kubernetes\nDesigning chaos experiments for software running on Kubernetes\nKilling subsets of applications running on Kubernetes to test their resilience\nInjecting network slowness using a proxy\n\nIt’s time to cover Kubernetes (https://kubernetes.io/). For anyone working in software engineering, it would have been really hard to not hear it mentioned at the very least. I personally had never seen an open-source project become so popular so quickly. I remember going to one of the first editions of KubeCon in London in 2016 to try to evaluate whether it was worth investing any time into this entire Kubernetes thing. Fast forward to 2020, and Kubernetes expertise is now one of the most demanded skills!\nKubernetes solves (or at least makes it easier to solve) a lot of problems that arise when running software across a fleet of machines. Its wide adoption indicates that it might be doing something right. But, like everything else, it’s not perfect and it adds its own complexity to the system--complexity that needs to be managed and understood, and one that lends well to the practices of chaos engineering.\nKubernetes is a big topic, so we’ll split it into three chapters:\n\nThis chapter: Chaos in Kubernetes\nQuick introduction to Kubernetes, where it came from and what it does.\nSetting up a test Kubernetes cluster. We’ll cover getting a mini cluster up and running because there is nothing like working on the real thing. If you have your own clusters you want to use, that’s perfectly fine too.\nTesting a real project’s resilience to failure. We’ll first apply chaos engineering to the application itself, to see how it copes with the basic types of failure we expect it to handle. We’ll set things up manually.\n\n\nChapter 11: Automating Kubernetes experiments\nIntroducing a high-level tool for chaos engineering on Kubernetes.\nUsing that tool to re-implement the experiments we set up manually in chapter 10 to teach you how to do it more easily.\nDesigning experiments for an ongoing verification of SLOs. We’ll see how to set things up to automatically detect problems on live systems, for example when an SLO is breached.\nDesigning experiments for the cloud layer. We’ll see how we can leverage cloud APIs to test how systems behave when machines go down.\n\n\nChapter 12: Under the hood of Kubernetes\nUnderstanding how Kubernetes itself works, and how to break it. This is where we dig deeper, and we test the actual Kubernetes components. We’ll cover the anatomy of a Kubernetes cluster and discuss various ideas for chaos experiments to verify our assumptions about how it handles failure.\n\n\n\nMy goal with these three chapters is to take you from a basic understanding of what Kubernetes is and how it works, all the way to knowing how things tick under the hood, and where the fragile points are and how chaos engineering can help with understanding and managing the way the system handles failure.\nThis is pretty exciting stuff, and I can’t wait to show you around! Like every good journey, let’s start ours with a story.\n"},"docs/Porting_things_onto_Kubernetes.html":{"url":"docs/Porting_things_onto_Kubernetes.html","title":"10.1 Porting things onto Kubernetes","keywords":"","body":"10.1 Porting things onto Kubernetes\n“It’s technically a promotion, and Kubernetes is really hot right now, so that’s going to be great for your career! So you’re in, right?” said Alice as she walked out of the room. As the door closed, it finally hit you, that even though what she said was phrased as a question, in her mind, there wasn’t much uncertainty about the outcome: You must save that High-Profile Project, period.\nThe project was weird from the beginning. The upper management announced it to a lot of fanfare and red-ribbon-cutting, but it was never made quite clear what function it was supposed to serve.--apart from “solving a lot of problems” by doing things like “getting rid of the monolith” and leveraging “the power of microservices” and the “amazing features of Kubernetes.” And - as if this wasn’t mysterious enough - the previous technical lead of the team just left the company. He really left. The last time someone was in contact with him, he was on his way to the Himalayas to start a new life as a llama breeder.\nTruth be told, you are the person for this job. People know you’re into chaos engineering, and they heard about the problems you uncovered with your experiments. If anyone can pick up where the llama-breeder-to-be left off and turn it into a reliable system, it’s you! You just need to learn how this entire Kubernetes thing works, what the High-Profile project is supposed to do, and then come up with a plan of attack. Lucky for you, this chapter will teach you exactly that. What a coincidence! Also, the documentation you inherited reveals some useful details. Let’s take a look at it.\n10.1.1 High-profile project documentation\nThere isn’t much documentation for the High-Profile Project, so I’ll just paste it verbatim for you to get the full experience. Turns out that, rather suitably, the project is called ICANT. Here’s how the document describes this acronym:\nICANT - International, Crypto-fueled, AI-powered, Next-generation market Tracking\nA little cryptic, isn’t it? It’s almost like someone designed it to be confusing to raise more funds. Something to do with AI and cryptocurrencies. But wait, there is a mission statement too, maybe this clears things up a little bit:\nBuild a massively-scalable, distributed system for tracking cryptocurrency flows with cutting-edge AI for technologically advanced clients all over the world.\n\nNo, not really; that doesn’t help much. Fortunately there is more. The section on current status reveals that we don’t need to worry about the AI, crypto or market stuff - that’s all on the TODO list. This is what it says:\nCurrent status: first we approached the “distributed” part. We’re running Kubernetes, so we set up Goldpinger that makes connections between all the nodes to simulate the crypto traffic.\nTODO: the AI stuff, the crypto stuff and markets stuff\n\nAll of a sudden, starting a new life in the Himalayas makes much more sense! They took a network diagnostic tool Goldpinger (https://github.com/bloomberg/goldpinger - by yours truly), deployed it on their Kubernetes cluster, put all the actual work in the TODO, and left the company. And now it’s your problem!\nWhat does Goldpinger actually do? It produces a full graph of Kubertnetes cluster connectivity by calling all instances of itself, measuring the times and producing reports based on that data. Typically one runs an instance of Goldpinger per node in their cluster to detect any networking issues across nodes. See figure 10.1 for an example of what a graph like that looks like with a single node having connectivity issues. The Goldpinger UI uses colors (green for OK, red for trouble), and I marked the affected link in the screenshot.\nFigure 10.1 Goldpinger graph showing connectivity between nodes in a Kubernetes cluster\n\nFor any crypto-AI-market-tracking enthusiast this is going to be an anti-climax. But from our point of view, it makes the job easier: we have a single component to work with that doesn’t require any buzzwords knowledge. We can do it. First stop - a quick intro to Kubernetes.

That sounds great, but what does that really mean?\nLet’s start simple. Let’s say you have a piece of software that you need to run on your computer. You can start your laptop, log in, and run the program. Congratulations, you just did a manual deployment of your software! So far so good.\nNow, imagine that you need the same piece of software to run not on 1, but on 10 computers. All of a sudden, logging into 10 computers doesn’t sound so attractive, so you begin to think about automating that deployment. You could hack together a script that uses SSH to remotely log into the 10 computers and start your program. Or you could use one of the many existing configuration management tools, like Ansible (https://github.com/ansible/ansible) or Chef (https://www.chef.io/). With 10 computers to take care of, it might just work.\nUnfortunately, it turns out that the program you started on these machines sometimes crashes. It might not even be a bug, but other problems, for example insufficient disk storage. So you need something to supervise the process, and try to bring it back up when it crashes. You could achieve that by making your configuration management tool configure a systemd service (https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html) so that the process gets restarted automatically every time it dies.\nThe software also needs to be upgraded. Every time you want to deploy a new version, you need to rerun your configuration management solution to stop and uninstall the previous version, and then install and start the new one. Also, the new version has different dependencies, so you need to take care of that too, during the update. Oh, and now your cluster contains 200 machines, because other people like your program, and then want you to run their software too (no need to reinvent the wheel for each piece of software we want to deploy, right?), so it’s beginning to take a long time to roll a new version out.\nEvery machine has limited resources (CPU, RAM, disk space), so you now have this massive spreadsheet to keep track of what software should run on which machine, so that they don’t run out of resources. When you onboard a new project, you allocate resources to it, and mark where it should run in the spreadsheet. And when one of the machines goes down, you look for some available room elsewhere, and migrate the software from the affected machine onto another one. It’s hard work, but people keep coming, so you must be doing something right!\nWouldn’t it be great, if there was a program that can do all this for you? Well, yes, you guessed it, it’s called Kubernetes; it does all this and more. Where did it come from?\n10.2.1 The very brief history of Kubernetes\nKubernetes, from a Greek word meaning “helmsman” or “governor,” is an open source project released by Google in 2015 as a reimplementation of their internal scheduler system called Borg (https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/). Google donated Kubernetes to a newly formed foundation called Cloud Native Computing Foundation (or CNCF for short https://www.cncf.io/), which created a neutral home for the project and encouraged a massive influx of investment from other companies.\nIt worked. In the short five years since the project creation, it has become a defacto API for scheduling containers. As companies adopted the open source project, Google managed to pull people away from investing more into AWS-specific solutions, and its cloud offering has gained more clout.\nAlong the way, the CNCF also gained many auxiliary projects that work with Kubernetes, like the monitoring system Prometheus (https://prometheus.io/), container runtime Containerd (https://containerd.io/) and figuratively tons more.\nIt all sounds great, but the real question that leads to a wide adoption is: what can it do for you? Let me show you.\n10.2.2 What can Kubernetes do for you?\nKubernetes works declaratively, rather than imperatively. What I mean by that is that it lets you describe the software you want to run on your cluster, and it continuously tries to converge the current cluster state into the one you requested. It also lets you read the current state at any given time. Conceptually, it’s an API for herding cats (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/herd_cats).\nTo use Kubernetes, you need a Kubernetes cluster. A Kubernetes cluster is a set of machines that run the Kubernetes components, and that make their resources (CPU, RAM, disk space) available to be allocated and used by your software. These machines are typically called worker nodes. A single Kubernetes cluster can have thousands of worker nodes.\nLet’s say that you have a cluster, and you want to run some new software on that cluster. There are three worker nodes in your cluster, each containing a certain amount of resources that are available. Imagine that one of your workers has a moderate amount of resources available, a second one has plenty available, and the third one is entirely used. Depending on the resources the new piece of software needs, your cluster might be able to run it on the first or the second but not the third worker node. Visually, it could look like figure 10.2. Note, that it’s possible (and sometimes pretty useful) to have heterogeneous nodes, with various configurations of resources available.\nFigure 10.2 Resources available in a small Kubernetes cluster\n\nWhat would starting new software on this cluster look like? All you need to do is tell your cluster what your software looks like (the container image to run, any configuration like environment variables of secrets), how much resources you want to give it (CPU, RAM, disk space), and how to run it (how many copies, any constraints on where it should run). You do that by making an HTTP request to the Kubernetes API (or using a tool, like the official CLI called kubectl). The part of the cluster that receives the request, stores it as the desired state, and immediately goes to work in the background on converging the current state of the cluster to the desired state is often referred to as the control plane. Let’s say that you want to deploy version v1.0 of mysoftware. You need to allocate 1 core and 1GB of RAM for each copy, and you need to run two copies for high availability. To make sure that one worker going down doesn’t take both copies down with it, you add a constraint that the two copies shouldn’t run on the same worker node. You send this request to the control plane, which stores it and returns OK. In the background, the same control plane calculates where to schedule the new software, finds two workers with enough available resources and notifies these workers to start your software. See figure 10.3 which shows this process visually.\nFigure 10.3 Interacting with a Kubernetes cluster\n\nAnd voila! That’s what Kubernetes can do for you. Instead of making your machines do specific, low-level tasks like starting a process, you can tell your cluster to figure out how to do what you need it to do. This is a 10,000-feet aerial view, but don’t worry, we’ll get into the nitty gritty later in the chapter. Right now, I bet you can’t wait for some hands-on experience. Let’s get to that by setting up a test cluster.\nNOTE POP QUIZ: WHAT’S KUBERNETES?\nPick one:\n\nA solution to all of your problems\nA software that automatically renders the system running on it immune to failure\nA container orchestrator that can managed thousands of VMs and will continuously try to converge the current state into the desired state\nA thing for sailors\n\nSee appendix B for answers.\n\n"},"docs/Setting_up_a_Kubernetes_cluster.html":{"url":"docs/Setting_up_a_Kubernetes_cluster.html","title":"10.3 Setting up a Kubernetes cluster","keywords":"","body":"10.3 Setting up a Kubernetes cluster\nBefore we can continue with our scenario, you’re going to need access to a working Kubernetes cluster. The beauty of Kubernetes, is that you can get the cluster from various providers, and it should behave exactly the same! All the examples in this chapter will work on any conformant clusters and I will mention where there might be potential caveats. Therefore you’re free to pick whatever installation of Kubernetes is the most convenient for you.\nFor those who don’t have a Kubernetes cluster handy, the easiest way to get started is to deploy a single-node, local mini-cluster on your local machine with Minikube (https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube). Minikube is an official part of Kubernetes itself, and allows you to deploy a single node with single instances of all the Kubernetes control plane components inside of a virtual machine. It also takes care of the little-yet-crucial things like helping you easily access things running inside of the cluster.\nBefore continuing, please follow Appendix A to install Minikube. In this chapter, I’ll assume you’re following along with a Minikube installation on your laptop. I’ll also mention whatever might be different if you’re not. Everything in this chapter was tested on Minikube 1.12.3, and Kubernetes 1.18.3.\n10.3.1 Starting a cluster\nDepending on the platform, Minikube supports multiple virtualization options to run the actual VM with Kubernetes. The options differ for each platform and include:\n\nLinux: KVM or VirtualBox (running processes directly on the host is also supported)\nmacOS: HyperKit, VMware Fusion, Parallels or VirtualBox\nWindows: Hyper-V or VirtualBox\n\nFor our purposes, you can pick any of the supported options and it should work all the same. But because I already made you install VirtualBox for the previous chapters and it’s a common denominator of all three supported platforms, I’d recommend we stick with VirtualBox.\nTo start a cluster, all you need is the minikube start command. To specify the VirtualBox driver, use the --driver flag. Run the following command from a terminal to start a new cluster using VirtualBox:\nminikube start --driver=virtualbox\n\nThe command might take a minute, because minikube needs to download the VM image for your cluster and then start a VM with that image. When it’s done, you will see the output similar to the following. Someone took the time to pick relevant emoticons for each log message, so I took the time to respect that and copy verbatim. You can see that it used the VirtualBox driver like I requested and defaulted to give the VM 2 CPUs, 4GB of RAM and 2GB of storage. It’s also running Kubernetes v1.18.3 on Docker 19.03.12 (all in bold font).\n😄  minikube v1.12.3 on Darwin 10.14.6 \n✨  Using the virtualbox driver based on user configuration \n👍  Starting control plane node minikube in cluster minikube \n🔥  Creating virtualbox VM (CPUs=2, Memory=4000MB, Disk=20000MB) … \n🐳  Preparing Kubernetes v1.18.3 on Docker 19.03.12 … \n🔎  Verifying Kubernetes components… \n🌟  Enabled addons: default-storageclass, storage-provisioner \n🏄  Done! kubectl is now configured to use \"minikube\"\n\nTo confirm that it started OK, try to list all pods running on the cluster. Run the following command in a terminal:\nkubectl get pods -A\n\nYou will see the output just like the following, listing the different components that together make the Kubernetes control plane. We will cover in detail how they work later in this chapter. For now, this command working at all proves that the control plane works.\nNAMESPACE     NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE \nkube-system   coredns-66bff467f8-62g9p           1/1     Running   0          5m44s \nkube-system   etcd-minikube         1/1     Running   0          5m49s \nkube-system   kube-apiserver-minikube            1/1     Running   0          5m49s \nkube-system   kube-controller-manager-minikube   1/1     Running   0          5m49s \nkube-system   kube-proxy-bwzcf      1/1     Running   0          5m44s \nkube-system   kube-scheduler-minikube            1/1     Running   0          5m49s \nkube-system   storage-provisioner                1/1     Running   0          5m49s\n\nWe’re now ready to go.

For example, to get help about the available options of the get command, just run kubectl get --help.\n\nTime to get our hands dirty with the High Profile Project.\n"},"docs/Testing_out_software_running_on_Kubernetes.html":{"url":"docs/Testing_out_software_running_on_Kubernetes.html","title":"10.4 Testing out software running on Kubernetes","keywords":"","body":"10.4 Testing out software running on Kubernetes\nWith a functional Kubernetes cluster at our disposal, we’re now ready to start working on the High Profile Project, aka ICANT. The pressure is on, we have a project to save!\nAs always, the first step is to build an understanding of how things work before we can reason about how they break. We’ll do that by kicking the tires and looking how ICANT is deployed and configured. Once we’re done with that, we’ll conduct two experiments and then finish this section by seeing how to make things easier for ourselves for the next time. Let’s start at the beginning - by running the actual project\n10.4.1 Running the ICANT Project\nAs we discovered earlier when reading the documentation you inherited, the project didn’t get very far. They took an off-the-shelf component (Goldpinger), deployed it, and called it a day. All of which is bad news for the project, but good news to me; I have less explaining to do!\nGoldpinger works by querying Kubernetes for all the instances of itself, and then periodically calling each of these instances and measuring the response time. It then uses that data to generate statistics (metrics) and plot a pretty connectivity graph. Each instance works in the same way - it periodically gets the address of its peers, and makes a request to each one of them. This is illustrated in figure 10.4. Goldpinger was invented to detect network slow-downs and problems, especially in larger clusters. It’s really simple and very effective.\nFigure 10.4 Overview of how Goldpinger works\n\nHow do we go about running it? We’ll do it in two steps:\n\nSet up the right permissions, so that Goldpinger can query Kubernetes for its peer\nDeploy it on the cluster\n\nWe’re about to step into Kubernetes Wonderland, so let me introduce you to some Kubernetes lingo.\nKubernetes terminology\nThe documentation often mentions resources to mean the objects representing various abstractions that Kubernetes offers. For now, I’m going to introduce you to three basic building blocks used to describe software on Kubernetes:\n\nPod. A pod is a collection of containers that are grouped together, run on the same host and share some system resources, for example an IP address. This is the unit of software that you can schedule on Kubernetes. You can schedule pods directly, but most of the time you will be using a higher level abstraction, such as a Deployment.\nDeployment. A deployment describes a blueprint for creating pods, along with extra metadata, like for example the number of replicas to run. Importantly, it also manages the lifecycle of pods that it creates. For example, if you modify a deployment to update a version of the image you want to run, the deployment can handle a rollout, deleting old pods and creating new ones one by one to avoid an outage. It also offers other things, like roll-back, if the roll out ever fails.\nService. A service matches an arbitrary set of pods, and provides a single IP address that resolves to the matched pods. That IP is kept up to date with the changes made to the cluster. For example, if a pod goes down, it will be taken out of the pool.\n\nYou can see a visual representation of how these fit together in figure 10.5.\nFigure 10.5 Pods, deployments and services example in Kubernetes\n\nAnother thing you need to know to understand how Goldpinger works is that to query Kubernetes, you need to have the right permissions.\nNOTE POP QUIZ: WHAT’S A KUBERNETES DEPLOYMENT?\nPick one:\n\nA description of how to reach software running on your cluster\nA description of how to deploy some software on your cluster\nA description of how to build a container\n\nSee appendix B for answers.\n\nPermissions\nKubernetes has an elegant way of managing permissions. First, it has a concept of a ClusterRole, that allows you to define a role and a corresponding set of permissions to execute verbs (create, get, delete, list, …) on various resources. Second, it has the concept of ServiceAccounts, which can be linked to any software running on Kubernetes, so that it inherits all the permissions that the ServiceAccount was granted. And finally, to make a link between a ServiceAccount and a ClusterRole, you can use a ClusterRoleBinding, which does exactly what it says on the tin.\nIf you’re new to it, this permissioning might sound a little bit abstract, so take a look at figure 10.6 for a graphical representation of how all of this comes together.\nFigure 10.6 Kubernetes permissioning example\n\nIn our case, we want to allow Goldpinger pods to list its peers, so all we need is a single ClusterRole, and the corresponding ServiceAccount and ClusterRoleBinding. Later, we will use that ServiceAccount to permission the Goldpinger pods.\nCreating the resources\nTime for some code! In Kubernetes, we can describe all resources we want to create using a Yaml file (.yml; https://yaml.org/) that follows the specific format that Kubernetes accepts. See listing 10.1 to see how all of this permissioning translates into .yml. For each element we described, there is a Yaml object, specifying the corresponding type (kind) and the expected parameters. First, a ClusterRole called goldpinger-clusterrol that allows for listing pods (bold font). Then a ServiceAccount called goldpinger-serviceaccount (bold font). And finally, a ClusterRoleBinding, linking the ClusterRole to the ServiceAccount. If you’re new to Yaml, note that the --- separators allow for describing multiple resources in a single file.\nListing 10.1 goldpinger-rbac.yaml\n---\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: ClusterRole                              #A\nmetadata:\n  name: goldpinger-clusterrole\nrules:\n- apiGroups:\n  - \"\"\n  resources:\n  - pods                                       #B\n  verbs:\n  - list                                       #C\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount                           #D\nmetadata:\n  name: goldpinger-serviceaccount\n  namespace: default\n---\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: ClusterRoleBinding\nmetadata:\n  name: goldpinger-clusterrolebinding\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: goldpinger-clusterrole                 #E\nsubjects:\n  - kind: ServiceAccount\n    name: goldpinger-serviceaccount            #F\n    namespace: default\n\n#A we start with a cluster role\n#B the cluster role gets permissions for resource of type pod\n#C the cluster role gets permissions to list the resource of type pod\n#D we create a service account to use later\n#E we create a cluster role binding, that binds the cluster role...\n#F … to the service account\nThis takes care of the permissionsing part. Let’s now go ahead and see what deploying the actual Goldpinger looks like.\nGoldpinger .yml files\nTo make sense of deploying Goldpinger, I need to explain one more detail that I skipped over so far: matching and labels.\nKubernetes makes extensive use of labels, which are simple key-value pairs of type string. Every resource can have arbitrary metadata attached to it, including labels. They are used by Kubernetes to match sets of resources, and are fairly flexible and easy to use.\nFor example, let’s say that you have two pods, with the following labels:\n\nPod A, with labels app=goldpinger and stage=dev\nPod B, with labels app=goldpinger and stage=prod\n\nIf you match (select) all pods with label app=goldpinger, you will get both pods. But if you match with label stage=dev, you will only get pod A. You can also query by multiple labels, and in that case Kubernetes will return pods matching all requested labels (a logical AND).\nLabels are useful for manually grouping resources, but they’re also leveraged by Kubernetes, for example to implement deployments. When you create a deployment, you need to specify the selector (a set of labels to match), and that selector needs to match the pods created by the deployment. The connection between the deployment and the pods it manages relies on labels.\nLabel-matching is also the same mechanism that Goldpinger leverages to query for its peers: it just asks Kubernetes for all pods with a specific label (by default app=goldpinger). Figure 10.7 shows that graphically.\nFigure 10.7 Kubernetes permissioning example\n\nPutting this all together, we can finally write a .yml file with two resource descriptors: a deployment and a matching service.\nInside the deployment, we need to specify the following:\n\nThe number of replicas (we’ll go with three for demonstration purposes)\nThe selector (again the default app=goldpinger),\nThe actual template of pods to create\n\nIn the pod template, we will specify the container image to run, some environment values required for Goldpinger to work and ports to expose so that other instances can reach it. The important bit is that we need to specify some arbitrary port that matches the PORT environment variable (this is what Goldpinger uses to know what port to listen on). We’ll go with 8080. Finally, we also specify the service account we created earlier on, to permission the Goldpinger pods to query Kubernetes for their peers.\nInside the service, we once again use the same selector (app=goldpinger), so that the service matches the pods created by the deployment, and the same port 8080 that we specified on the deployment.\nNOTE DEPLOYMENTS AND DAEMONSETS\nIn a typical installation, we would like to have one Goldpinger pod per node (physical machine, VM) in your cluster. That can be easily achieved by using a DaemonSet (it works a lot like a deployment, but instead of specifying the number of replicas, it just assumes one replica per node - learn more at https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/). In our example setup we will use a Deployment instead, because with only one node, we would only have a single pod of Goldpinger, which defeats the purpose of this demonstration.\n\nListing 10.2 contains the .yml file we can use to create the deployment and the service. Take a look.\nListing 10.2 goldpinger.yml .\n---\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: goldpinger\n  namespace: default\n  labels:\n    app: goldpinger\nspec:\n  replicas: 3                                                #A\n  selector:                                                  #B\n    matchLabels:\n      app: goldpinger\n  template:\n    metadata:                                                #C\n      labels:\n        app: goldpinger\n    spec:\n      serviceAccount: \"goldpinger-serviceaccount\"\n      containers:\n      - name: goldpinger\n        image: \"docker.io/bloomberg/goldpinger:v3.0.0\"\n        env:\n        - name: REFRESH_INTERVAL\n          value: \"2\"\n        - name: HOST\n          value: \"0.0.0.0\"\n        - name: PORT\n          value: \"8080\"                                      #D\n        # injecting real pod IP will make things easier to understand\n        - name: POD_IP\n          valueFrom:\n            fieldRef:\n              fieldPath: status.podIP\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 8080                                #E\n          name: http\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: goldpinger\n  namespace: default\n  labels:\n    app: goldpinger\nspec:\n  type: LoadBalancer\n  ports:\n    - port: 8080                                             #F\n      name: http\n  selector:\n    app: goldpinger                                          #G\n\n#A the deployment will create three replicas of the pods (three pods)\n#B the deployment is configured to match pods with label app=goldpinger\n#C the pods template actually gets the label app=goldpinger\n#D we configure the Goldpinger pods to run on port 8080\n#E we expose the port 8080 on the pod, so that it’s reachable\n#F in the service, we target port 8080 that we made available on the pods\n#G the service will target pods based on the label app=goldpinger\nWith that, we’re now ready to actually start it! If you’re following along, you can find the source code for both of these files (goldpinger-rbac.yml and goldpinger.yml) at https://github.com/seeker89/chaos-engineering-book/tree/master/examples/kubernetes. Let’s make sure that both files are in the same folder, and let’s go ahead and run them.\nDeploying Goldpinger\nStart by creating the permissioning resources (the goldpinger-rbac.yml file), by running the following command: \n   kubectl apply -f goldpinger-rbac.yml\n\nYou will see Kubernetes confirming the three resources were created successfully, with the following output:\nclusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/goldpinger-clusterrole created \n  serviceaccount/goldpinger-serviceaccount created \n  clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/goldpinger-clusterrolebinding created\n\nThen, create the actual deployment and a service by running the following command:\nkubectl apply -f goldpinger.yml\n\nJust like before, you will see the confirmation that the resources were created:\ndeployment.apps/goldpinger created\nservice/goldpinger created\n\nOnce that’s done, let’s confirm that pods are running as expected. To do that, list the pods by running the following command:\nkubectl get pods\n\nYou should see an output similar to the following, with three pods in status Running (bold font). If they’re not, you might need to give it a few seconds to start:\nNAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\ngoldpinger-c86c78448-5kwpp   1/1     Running   0          1m4s\ngoldpinger-c86c78448-gtbvv   1/1     Running   0          1m4s\ngoldpinger-c86c78448-vcwx2   1/1     Running   0          1m4s\n\nThe pods are running, meaning that the deployment did its job. Goldpinger crashes if it can’t list its peers, which means that the permissioning we set up also works as expected. The last thing to check, is that the service was configured correctly. You can do that by running the following command, specifying the name of the service we created (“goldpinger”):\nkubectl describe svc goldpinger\n\nYou will see the details of the service, just like in the following output (abbreviated). Note the Endpoints field, specifying three IP addresses, for the three pods that it’s configured to match.\nName:        goldpinger\nNamespace:                default\nLabels:      app=goldpinger\n(...)\nEndpoints:                172.17.0.3:8080,172.17.0.4:8080,172.17.0.5:8080\n(...)\n\nIf you want to be 100% sure that the IPs are correct, you can compare them to the IPs of Goldpinger pods. You can display them easily, by appending -o wide (for wide output) to the kubectl get pods command. Try it by running the following:\nkubectl get pods -o wide\n\nYou will see the same list as before, but this time with extra details, including the IP (bold font). They should correspond to the list specified in the service. If they weren’t, it would point to misconfigured labels. Note, that depending on your internet connection speed and your setup, it might take a little bit of time to start. If you see pods in pending state, give it an extra minute:\nNAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP           NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES\ngoldpinger-c86c78448-5kwpp   1/1     Running   0          15m   172.17.0.4   minikube              \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-gtbvv   1/1     Running   0          15m   172.17.0.3   minikube              \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-vcwx2   1/1     Running   0          15m   172.17.0.5   minikube              \n\nEverything's up and running, so let’s access Goldpinger to see what it’s really doing. To do that, we’ll need to access the service we created.\nNOTE ACCESSING THE SOFTWARE RUNNING ON KUBERNETES FROM OUTSIDE THE CLUSTER\nKubernetes does a great job standardizing the way people run their software. Unfortunately, not everything is easily standardized. Although every Kubernetes cluster supports services, the way you access the cluster and therefore its services depends on the way the cluster was set up. In this chapter, we will stick to Minikube, because it’s simple and easily accessible to anyone. If you’re running your own Kubernetes cluster, or use a managed solution from one of the cloud providers, accessing software running on the cluster might involve some extra setup (for example setting up an Ingress https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/). Refer to the relevant documentation.\n\nOn Minikube, we can leverage the command minikube service, which will figure out a way to access the service directly from your host machine and open the browser for you. To do that, run the following command:\nminikube service goldpinger\n\nYou will see an output similar to the following, specifying the special URL that Minikube prepared for you (bold font). Your default browser will be launched to open that URL.\n|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n| NAMESPACE |    NAME    | TARGET PORT |             URL             |\n|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n| default   | goldpinger | http/8080   | http://192.168.99.100:30426 |\n|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n🎉  Opening service default/goldpinger in default browser…\n\nInside the newly launched browser window, you will see the Goldpinger UI. It will look similar to what’s shown in figure 10.8. It’s a graph, on which every point represents an instance of Goldpinger, and every arrow represents the last connectivity check (an HTTP request) between the instances. You can click a node to select it and display extra information. It also provides other functionality like a heatmap, showing hotspots of any potential networking slowness; and metrics, providing statistics that can be used to generate alerts and pretty dashboards. Goldpinger is a really handy tool for detecting any network issues, downloaded more than a million times from Docker Hub!\nFigure 10.8 Goldpinger UI in action\n\nFeel free to take some time to play around, but otherwise we’re done setting it all up. We have a running application that we can interact with, all deployed with just two kubectl commands.\nUnfortunately, on our little test cluster, all three instances are running on the same host, so we’re unlikely to see any network slowness, which is pretty boring. Fortunately, as chaos engineering practitioners, we’re well equipped to introduce failure and make things interesting again. Let’s start with the basics - an experiment to kill some pods.\n10.4.2 Experiment 1: kill 50% of pods\nMuch like a villain from a comic book movie, we might be interested in seeing what happens when we kill 50% of Goldpinger pods. Why do that? It’s an inexpensive experiment that can answer a lot of questions about what happens when one of these instances goes down (simulating a machine going down). For example:\n\nDo the other instances detect that to begin with?\nIf so, how long before they detect it?\nHow does Goldpinger configuration affect all of that?\nIf we had an alert set up, would it get triggered?\n\nHow should we go about implementing this? In the previous chapters, we’ve covered different ways this could be addressed. For example, you could log into the machine running the Goldpinger process you want to kill, and simply run a kill command, like we did before. Or, if your cluster uses Docker to run the containers (more on that soon), you could leverage the tools we’ve covered in chapter 5. The point is that all of the techniques you learned in the previous chapter still apply. That said, Kubernetes gives us other options, like directly deleting pods. It’s definitely the most convenient way of achieving that, so let’s go with that option.\nThere is another crucial detail to our experiment: Goldpinger works by periodically making HTTP requests to all of its peers. That period is controlled by the environment variable called REFRESH_PERIOD. In the goldpinger.yml file you deployed, that value was set to 2 seconds:\nname: REFRESH_INTERVAL \n  value: \"2\"\n\nThat means that the maximum time it takes for an instance to notice another instance being down is 2 seconds. This is pretty aggressive and in a large cluster would result in a lot of traffic and CPU time spent on this, but I chose that value for our demonstration purposes. It will be handy to see the changes detected quickly. With that, we now have all the elements, so let’s turn this into a concrete plan of an experiment.\nExperiment 1: plan\nIf we take the first question we mentioned (do other Goldpinger instances detect a peer down), we can design a simple experiment plan like so:\n\nObservability: use Goldpinger UI to see if there are any pods marked as inaccessible; use kubectl to see new pods come and go\nSteady state: all nodes healthy\nHypothesis: if we delete one pod, we should see it in marked as failed in Goldpinger UI, and then be replaced by a new, healthy pod\nRun the experiment\n\nThat’s it! Let’s see how to implement it.\nExperiment 1: implementation\nTo implement this experiment, the pod labels come in useful once again. All we need to do is leverage kubectl get pods to get all pods with label app=goldpinger, pick a random pod and kill it, using kubectl delete. To make things easy, we can also leverage kubectl’s -o name flag to only display the pod names, and use a combination of sort --random-sort and head -n1 to pick a random line of the output. Put all of this together, and you get a script like kube-thanos.sh from listing 10.3. Store it somewhere on your system (or clone it from the Github repo).\nListing 10.3 kube-thanos.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\nkubectl get pods \\                #A\n  -l app=goldpinger \\             #B\n  -o name \\                       #C\n    | sort --random-sort \\        #D\n    | head -n 1 \\                 #E\n    | xargs kubectl delete        #F\n\n#A use kubectl to list pods\n#B only list pods with label app=goldpinger\n#C only display the name as the output\n#D sort in random order\n#E pick the first one\n#F delete the pod\nArmed with that, we’re ready to rock. Let’s run the experiment.\nExperiment 1: run!\nLet’s start by double-checking the steady state. Your Goldpinger installation should still be running and you should have the UI open in a browser window. If it’s not, you can bring both back up by running the following commands:\nkubectl apply -f goldpinger-rbac.yml \n  kubectl apply -f goldpinger.yml \n  minikube service goldpinger\n\nTo confirm all nodes are OK, simply refresh the graph by clicking the “reload” button, and verify that all three nodes are showing in green. So far so good.\nTo confirm that our script works, let’s also set up some observability for the pods being deleted and created. We can leverage the --watch flag of the kubectl get command to print the names of all pods coming and going to the console. You can do that by opening a new terminal window, and running the following command:\nkubectl get pods --watch\n\nYou will see the familiar output, showing all the Goldpinger pods, but this time the command will stay active, blocking the terminal. You can use Ctrl-C to exit at any time, if needed.\nNAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-6rtw4   1/1     Running   0          20h \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-mj76q   1/1     Running   0          19h \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-xbj7s   1/1     Running   0          19h\n\nNow, to the fun part! To conduct our experiment, we’ll open another terminal window for the kube-thanos.sh script, run it to kill a random pod, and then quickly go to the Goldpinger UI to observe what the Goldpinger pods saw. Bear in mind that in the local setup, the pods will recover very rapidly, so you might need to be quick to actually observe the pod becoming unavailable and then healing. In the meantime, the kubectl get pods --watch command will record the pod going down and a replacement coming up. Let’s do that!\nOpen a new terminal window and run the script to kill a random pod:\nbash kube-thanos.sh\n\nYou will see an output showing the name of the pod being deleted, like in the following:\npod \"goldpinger-c86c78448-shtdq\" deleted\n\nGo quickly to the Goldpinger UI and click refresh. You should see some failure, like in figure 10.9. Nodes that can’t be reached by at least one other node will be marked as unhealthy. I marked the unhealthy node in the figure. The live UI also uses a red color to differentiate them. You will also notice that there are four nodes showing up. This is because after the pod is deleted, Kubernetes tries to recoverge to the desired state (three replicas), so it creates a new pod to replace the one we deleted.\nNOTE BE QUICK!\nIf you’re not seeing any errors, the pods probably recovered before you switched to the UI window, because your computer is quicker than mine when I was writing this and chose the parameters. If you re-run the command and refresh the UI more quickly, you should be able to see it.\n\nFigure 10.9 Goldpinger UI showing an unavailable pod being replaced by a new one\n\nNow, go back to the terminal window that is running kubectl get pods --watch. You will see an output similar to the following. Note the pod that we killed (-shtdq) going into Terminating state, and a new pod (-lwxrq) taking its place (both in bold font). You will also notice that the new pod goes through a lifecycle of Pending to ContainerCreating to Running, while the old one goes to Terminating.\nNAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-pfqmc   1/1     Running   0          47s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-shtdq   1/1     Running   0          22s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-xbj7s   1/1     Running   0          20h \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-shtdq   1/1     Terminating   0          38s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-lwxrq   0/1     Pending       0          0s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-lwxrq   0/1     Pending       0          0s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-lwxrq   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-shtdq   0/1     Terminating         0          39s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-lwxrq   1/1     Running             0          2s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-shtdq   0/1     Terminating         0          43s \ngoldpinger-c86c78448-shtdq   0/1     Terminating         0          43s\n\nFinally, let’s check that everything recovered smoothly. To do that, go back to the browser window with Goldpinger UI, and refresh once more. You should now see the three new pods happily pinging each other, all in green. Which means that our hypothesis was correct, on both fronts.\nNice job. Another one bites the dust, another experiment under your belt. But before we move on, let’s just discuss a few points.\nNOTE POP QUIZ: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A POD DIES ON A KUBERNETES CLUSTER?\nPick one:\n\nKubernetes detects it and send you an alert\nKubernetes detects it, and will restart it as necessary to make sure the expected number of replicas are running\nNothing\n\nSee appendix B for answers.\n\nExperiment 1: discussion\nFor the sake of teaching, I took a few shortcuts here that I want to make you aware of. First, when accessing the pods through the UI, we’re using a service, which resolves to a pseudo-random instance of Goldpinger every time you make a new call. That means that it’s possible to get routed to the instance we just killed, and get an error in the UI. It also means that every time you refresh the view, you get the reality from a point of view of a different pod. For illustration purposes, that’s not a deal-breaker on a small test cluster but if you run a large cluster and want to make sure that a network partition doesn’t obscure your view, you will need to make sure you consult all available instances, or at least a reasonable subset. Goldpinger addresses that issue with metrics, and you can learn more about that at https://github.com/bloomberg/goldpinger#prometheus\nSecond, using a GUI-based tool this way is a little bit awkward. If you see what you expect, that’s great. But if you don’t, it doesn’t necessarily mean it didn’t happen, it might be that you simply missed it. Again, this can be alleviated by using the metrics, which I skipped here for the sake of simplicity.\nThird, if you look closely at the failures that you see in the graph, you will see that the pods sometimes start receiving traffic before they are actually up. This is because, again for simplicity, I skipped the readiness probe that serves exactly that purpose. If set, a readiness probe prevents a pod from receiving any traffic until a certain condition is met (see the documentation at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/). For an example of how to use it, see the installation docs of Goldpinger (https://github.com/bloomberg/goldpinger#installation).\nFinally, remember that depending on the refresh period you’re running Goldpinger with, the data you’re looking at is up to that many seconds stale, which means that for the pods we killed, we’ll keep seeing them for an extra number of seconds equal to the refresh period (2 seconds in our setup).\nThese are the caveats my lawyers advised me to clarify before this goes to print. In case that makes you think I’m not fun at parties, let me prove you wrong. Let’s play some Invaders, like it’s 1978.\n10.4.3 Party trick: killing pods in style\nIf you really want to make a point that chaos engineering is fun, I’ve got two tools for you.\nFirst, KubeInvaders (https://github.com/lucky-sideburn/KubeInvaders). It gamifies the process of killing pods by starting a clone of Space Invaders, where the aliens are pods in the specified namespace. You guessed it, the ones you shoot down are deleted in Kubernetes. Installation involves deploying it on a cluster, and then connecting a local client that actually displays the game content. See figure 10.10 to see what it looks like in action.\nFigure 10.10 Kubeinvader screenshot from https://github.com/lucky-sideburn/KubeInvaders\n\nThe second one is for fans of the first-person shooter genre: Kube DOOM (https://github.com/storax/kubedoom). Similar to KubeInvaders, it represents pods as enemies, and kills in Kubernetes the ones that die in the game. Tip to justify using it: it’s often much quicker than copying and pasting a name of a pod, saving so much time (mandatory reference: https://xkcd.com/303/). See figure 10.11 for a screenshot.\nFigure 10.11 Kube DOOM screenshot from https://github.com/storax/kubedoom\n\nFor Kube DOOM, the installation is pretty straightforward: you run a pod on the host, pass a kubectl configuration file to it, and then use a desktop sharing client to connect to the game. After a long day of debugging, it might be just what you need. I’ll just leave it there.\nI’m sure that will help with your next house party. When you finish the game, let’s take a look at another experiment - some good old network slowness.\n10.4.4 Experiment 2: network slowness\nSlowness, my nemesis, we meet again. If you’re a software engineer, chances are you’re spending a lot of your time trying to outwit slowness. When things go wrong, actual failure is often easier to debug than situations when things mostly work. And slowness tends to fall into the latter category.\nSlowness is such an important topic that we touch upon it in nearly every chapter of this book. We introduced some slowness using tc in chapter 4, and then again using Pumba in Docker in chapter 5. We use some in the context of JVM, application level ,and even browser in other chapters. Time to take a look at what’s different when running on Kubernetes.\nIt’s worth mentioning that everything we covered before still applies here. We could very well use tc or Pumba directly on one of the machines running the processes we’re interested in, and modify them to introduce the failure we care about. In fact, using kubectl cp and kubectl exec, we could upload and execute tc commands directly in a pod, without even worrying about accessing the host. Or we could even add a second container to the Goldpinger pod that would execute the necessary tc commands.\nAll of these options are viable, but share one downside: they modify the existing software that’s running on your cluster, and so by definition carry risks of messing things up. A convenient alternative is to add extra software, tweaked to implement the failure we care about, but otherwise identical to the original and introduce the extra software in a way that will integrate with the rest of the system. Kubernetes makes it really easy. Let me show you what I mean; let’s design an experiment around simulated network slowness.\nExperiment 2: plan\nLet’s say that we want to see what happens when one instance of Goldpinger is slow to respond to queries of its peers. After all, this is what this piece of software was designed to help with, so before we rely on it, we should test that it works as expected.\nA convenient way of doing that is to deploy a copy of Goldpinger that we can modify to add a delay. Once again, we could do it with tc, but to show you some new tools, let’s use a standalone network proxy instead. That proxy will sit in front of that new Goldpinger instance, receive the calls from its peers, add the delay, and relay the calls to Goldpinger. Thanks to Kubernetes, setting it all up is pretty straightforward.\nLet’s iron out some details. Goldpinger’s default timeout for all calls is 300ms, so let’s pick an arbitrary value of 250ms for our delay: enough to be clearly seen, but not enough to cause a timeout. And thanks to the built-in heatmap, we will be able to visually show the connections that take longer than others, so the observability aspect is taken care of. The plan of the experiment figuratively writes itself:\nTODO\n"},"docs/Summary_10.html":{"url":"docs/Summary_10.html","title":"10.5 Summary","keywords":"","body":"10.5 Summary\n\nKubernetes helps manage container orchestration at scale, but in doing that, it also introduces its own complexity that needs to be understood and managed\nIntroducing failure by killing pods is easy using kubectl\nThanks to Kubernetes, it’s practical to inject network issues by adding an extra network proxy; by doing so, we can also better control the blast radius\n\n"},"docs/Automating_Kubernetes_experiments.html":{"url":"docs/Automating_Kubernetes_experiments.html","title":"11 Automating Kubernetes experiments","keywords":"","body":""},"docs/Under_the_hood_of_Kubernetes.html":{"url":"docs/Under_the_hood_of_Kubernetes.html","title":"12 Under the hood of Kubernetes","keywords":"","body":""},"docs/Chaos_engineering_for_people.html":{"url":"docs/Chaos_engineering_for_people.html","title":"13 Chaos engineering (for) people","keywords":"","body":""}}}
