2021 (estimated)\nISBN 9781617297618  775 pages (estimated)  printed in black & white\n\nKubernetes is an essential tool for anyone deploying and managing cloud-native applications. Kubernetes in Action, Second Edition is a fully-updated and comprehensive guide to developing and running applications in a Kubernetes environment. It lays out a complete introduction to container technologies and containerized applications along with practical tips for efficient deployment and operation. This revised edition of the bestselling original contains new coverage of the Kubernetes architecture, including the Kubernetes API, and a deep dive into managing a Kubernetes cluster in production.\nabout the technology\nKubernetes is Greek for “helmsman,” your guide through unknown waters. The Kubernetes container orchestration system safely manages the structure and flow of a distributed application, organizing containers and services for maximum efficiency. Kubernetes serves as an operating system for your clusters, reducing the need to factor the underlying network and server infrastructure into your designs. As more and more applications are created using cloud-native and container-based architectures, Kubernetes has become an essential tool for modern developers to master.\nabout the book\nKubernetes in Action, Second Edition teaches you to use Kubernetes to deploy container-based distributed applications. You'll start with an overview of how Docker containers work with Kubernetes and move quickly to building your first cluster. You'll gradually expand your initial application, adding features and deepening your knowledge of Kubernetes architecture and operation. In this revised and expanded second edition, you’ll take a deep dive into the structure of a Kubernetes-based application and discover how to manage a Kubernetes cluster in production. As you navigate this comprehensive guide, you'll also appreciate thorough coverage of high-value topics like monitoring, tuning, and scaling.\n\nprogress\n\n"},"docs/Welcome.html":{"url":"docs/Welcome.html","title":"Welcome","keywords":"","body":"Welcome\nThank you for purchasing the MEAP for Kubernetes in Action 2nd Edition.\nAs part of my work at Red Hat, I started using Kubernetes in 2014, even before version 1.0 was released. Those were interesting times. Not many people working in the software industry knew about Kubernetes, and there was no real community yet. There were hardly any blog posts about it and the documentation was still very basic. Kubernetes itself was ridden with bugs. When you combine all these facts, you can imagine that working with Kubernetes was extremely difficult.\nIn 2015 I was asked by Manning to write the first edition of this book. The originally planned 300-page book grew to over 600 pages full of information. The writing forced me to also research those parts of Kubernetes that I wouldn’t have looked at more closely otherwise. I put most of what I learned into the book. Judging by their reviews and comments, readers love a detailed book like this.\nThe plan for the second edition of the book is to add even more information and to rearrange some of the existing content. The exercises in this book will take you from deploying a trivial application that initially uses only the basic features of Kubernetes to a full-fledged application that incorporates additional features as the book introduces them.\nThe book is divided into five parts. In the first part, after the introduction of Kubernetes and containers, you’ll deploy the application in the simplest way. In the second part you’ll learn the main concepts used to describe and deploy your application. After that you’ll explore the inner workings of Kubernetes components. This will give you a good foundation to learn the difficult part - how to manage Kubernetes in production. In the last part of the book you’ll learn about best practices and how to extend Kubernetes.\nI hope you all like this second edition even better than the first, and if you’re reading the book for the first time, your feedback will be even more valuable. If any part of the book is difficult to understand, please post your questions, comments or suggestions in the liveBook forum.\nThank you for helping me write the best book possible.\n—Marko Lukša\n"},"docs/Introducing_Kubernetes_0.html":{"url":"docs/Introducing_Kubernetes_0.html","title":"1 Introducing Kubernetes","keywords":"","body":"1.

This first chapter is intended to give a general overview of these topics.\n"},"docs/Introducing_Kubernetes_1.html":{"url":"docs/Introducing_Kubernetes_1.html","title":"1.1 Introducing Kubernetes","keywords":"","body":"1.1 Introducing Kubernetes\nThe word Kubernetes is Greek for pilot or helmsman, the person who steers the ship - the person standing at the helm (the ship’s wheel). A helmsman is not necessarily the same as a captain. A captain is responsible for the ship, while the helmsman is the one who steers it.\nAfter learning more about what Kubernetes does, you’ll find that the name hits the spot perfectly. A helmsman maintains the course of the ship, carries out the orders given by the captain and reports back the ship's heading. Kubernetes steers your applications and reports on their status while you - the captain - decide where you want the system to go.\nHow to pronounce Kubernetes and what is k8s?\nThe correct Greek pronunciation of Kubernetes, which is Kie-ver-nee-tees, is different from the English pronunciation you normally hear in technical conversations. Most often it’s Koo-ber-netties or Koo-ber-nay’-tace, but you may also hear Koo-ber-nets, although rarely.\nIn both written and oral conversations, it’s also referred to as Kube or K8s, pronounced Kates, where the 8 signifies the number of letters omitted between the first and last letter.\nKubernetes in a nutshell\nKubernetes is a software system for automating the deployment and management of complex, large-scale application systems composed of computer processes running in containers. Let’s learn what it does and how it does it.\nAbstracting away the infrastructure\nWhen software developers or operators decide to deploy an application, they do this through Kubernetes instead of deploying the application to individual computers. Kubernetes provides an abstraction layer over the underlying hardware to both users and applications.\nAs you can see in the following figure, the underlying infrastructure, meaning the computers, the network and other components, is hidden from the applications, making it easier to develop and configure them.\nFigure 1.1 Infrastructure abstraction using Kubernetes\n\nStandardizing how we deploy applications\nBecause the details of the underlying infrastructure no longer affect the deployment of applications, you deploy applications to your corporate data center in the same way as you do in the cloud. A single manifest that describes the application can be used for local deployment and for deploying on any cloud provider. All differences in the underlying infrastructure are handled by Kubernetes, so you can focus on the application and the business logic it contains.\nDeploying applications declaratively\nKubernetes uses a declarative model to define an application, as shown in the next figure. You describe the components that make up your application and Kubernetes turns this description into a running application. It then keeps the application healthy by restarting or recreating parts of it as needed.\nFigure 1.2 The declarative model of application deployment\n\nWhenever you change the description, Kubernetes will take the necessary steps to reconfigure the running application to match the new description, as shown in the next figure.\nFigure 1.3 Changes in the description are reflected in the running application\n\nTaking on the daily management of applications\nAs soon as you deploy an application to Kubernetes, it takes over the daily management of the application. If the application fails, Kubernetes will automatically restart it. If the hardware fails or the infrastructure topology changes so that the application needs to be moved to other machines, Kubernetes does this all by itself. The engineers responsible for operating the system can focus on the big picture instead of wasting time on the details.\nTo circle back to the sailing analogy: the development and operations engineers are the ship’s officers who make high-level decisions while sitting comfortably in their armchairs, and Kubernetes is the helmsman who takes care of the low-level tasks of steering the system through the rough waters your applications and infrastructure sail through.\nFigure 1.4 Kubernetes takes over the management of applications\n\nEverything that Kubernetes does and all the advantages it brings requires a longer explanation, which we’ll discuss later. Before we do that, it might help you to know how it all began and where the Kubernetes project currently stands.\nAbout the Kubernetes project\nKubernetes was originally developed by Google. Google has practically always run applications in containers. As early as 2014, it was reported that they start two billion containers every week. That’s over 3,000 containers per second, and the figure is much higher today. They run these containers on thousands of computers distributed across dozens of data centers around the world. Now imagine doing all this manually. It’s clear that you need automation, and at this massive scale, it better be perfect.\nAbout Borg and Omega - the predecessors of Kubernetes\nThe sheer scale of Google’s workload has forced them to develop solutions to make the development and management of thousands of software components manageable and cost-effective. Over the years, Google developed an internal system called Borg (and later a new system called Omega) that helped both application developers and operators manage these thousands of applications and services.\nIn addition to simplifying development and management, these systems have also helped them to achieve better utilization of their infrastructure. This is important in any organization, but when you operate hundreds of thousands of machines, even tiny improvements in utilization mean savings in the millions, so the incentives for developing such a system are clear.\nNOTE\nData on Google’s energy use suggests that they run around 900,000 servers.\n\nOver time, your infrastructure grows and evolves. Every new data center is state-of-the-art. Its infrastructure differs from those built in the past. Despite the differences, the deployment of applications in one data center should not differ from deployment in another data center. This is especially important when you deploy your application across multiple zones or regions to reduce the likelihood that a regional failure will cause application downtime. To do this effectively, it’s worth having a consistent method for deploying your applications.\nAbout Kubernetes - the open-source project - and commercial products derived from it\nBased on the experience they gained while developing Borg, Omega and other internal systems, in 2014 Google introduced Kubernetes, an open-source project that can now be used and further improved by everyone.\nFigure 1.5 The origins and state of the Kubernetes open-source project\n\nAs soon as Kubernetes was announced, long before version 1.0 was officially released, other companies, such as Red Hat, who has always been at the forefront of open-source software, quickly stepped on board and helped develop the project. It eventually grew far beyond the expectations of its founders, and today is arguably one of the world’s leading open-source projects, with dozens of organizations and thousands of individuals contributing to it.\nSeveral companies are now offering enterprise-quality Kubernetes products that are built from the open-source project. These include Red Hat OpenShift, Pivotal Container Service, Rancher and many others.\nHow Kubernetes grew a whole new cloud-native eco-system\nKubernetes has also spawned many other related open-source projects, most of which are now under the umbrella of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which is part of the Linux Foundation.\nCNCF organizes several KubeCon - CloudNativeCon conferences per year - in North America, Europe and China. In 2019, the total number of attendees exceeded 23,000, with KubeCon North America reaching an overwhelming number of 12,000 participants. These figures show that Kubernetes has had an incredibly positive impact on the way companies around the world deploy applications today. It wouldn’t have been so widely adopted if that wasn’t the case.\nUnderstanding why Kubernetes is so popular\nIn recent years, the way we develop applications has changed considerably. This has led to the development of new tools like Kubernetes, which in turn have fed back and fuelled further changes in application architecture and the way we develop them. Let’s look at concrete examples of this.\nAutomating the management of microservices\nIn the past, most applications were large monoliths. The components of the application were tightly coupled, and they all ran in a single computer process. The application was developed as a unit by a large team of developers and the deployment of the application was straightforward. You installed it on a powerful computer and provided the little configuration it required. Scaling the application horizontally was rarely possible, so whenever you needed to increase the capacity of the application, you had to upgrade the hardware - in other words, scale the application vertically.\nThen came the microservices paradigm. The monoliths were divided into dozens, sometimes hundreds, of separate processes, as shown in the following figure. This allowed organizations to divide their development departments into smaller teams where each team developed only a part of the entire system - just some of the microservices.\nFigure 1.6 Comparing monolithic applications with microservices\n\nEach microservice is now a separate application with its own development and release cycle. The dependencies of different microservices will inevitably diverge over time. One microservice requires one version of a library, while another microservice requires another, possibly incompatible, version of the same library. Running the two applications in the same operating system becomes difficult.\nFortunately, containers alone solve this problem where each microservice requires a different environment, but each microservice is now a separate application that must be managed individually. The increased number of applications makes this much more difficult.\nIndividual parts of the entire application no longer need to run on the same computer, which makes it easier to scale the entire system, but also means that the applications need to be configured to communicate with each other. For systems with only a handful of components, this can usually be done manually, but it’s now common to see deployments with well over a hundred microservices.\nWhen the system consists of many microservices, automated management is crucial. Kubernetes provides this automation. The features it offers make the task of managing hundreds of microservices almost trivial.\nBridging the dev and ops divide\nAlong with these changes in application architecture, we’ve also seen changes in the way teams develop and run software. It used to be normal for a development team to build the software in isolation and then throw the finished product over the wall to the operations team, who would then deploy it and manage it from there.\nWith the advent of the Dev-ops paradigm, the two teams now work much more closely together throughout the entire life of the software product. The development team is now much more involved in the daily management of the deployed software. But that means that they now need to know about the infrastructure on which it’s running.\nAs a software developer, your primary focus is on implementing the business logic. You don’t want to deal with the details of the underlying servers. Fortunately, Kubernetes hides these details.\nStandardizing the cloud\nOver the past decade or two, many organizations have moved their software from local servers to the cloud. The benefits of this seem to have outweighed the fear of being locked-in to a particular cloud provider, which is caused by relying on the provider’s proprietary APIs to deploy and manage applications.\nAny company that wants to be able to move its applications from one provider to another will have to make additional, initially unnecessary efforts to abstract the infrastructure and APIs of the underlying cloud provider from the applications. This requires resources that could otherwise be focused on building the primary business logic.\nKubernetes has also helped in this respect. The popularity of Kubernetes has forced all major cloud providers to integrate Kubernetes into their offerings. Customers can now deploy applications to any cloud provider through a standard set of APIs provided by Kubernetes.\nFigure 1.7 Kubernetes has standardized how you deploy applications on cloud providers\n\nIf the application is built on the APIs of Kubernetes instead of directly on the proprietary APIs of a specific cloud provider, it can be transferred relatively easily to any other provider.\n"},"docs/Understanding_Kubernetes.html":{"url":"docs/Understanding_Kubernetes.html","title":"1.2 Understanding Kubernetes","keywords":"","body":"1.2 Understanding Kubernetes\nThe previous section explained the origins of Kubernetes and the reasons for its wide adoption. In this section we’ll take a closer look at what exactly Kubernetes is.\nUnderstanding how Kubernetes transforms a computer cluster\nLet’s take a closer look at how the perception of the data center changes when you deploy Kubernetes on your servers.\nKubernetes is like an operating system for computer clusters\nOne can imagine Kubernetes as an operating system for the cluster. The next figure illustrates the analogies between an operating system running on a computer and Kubernetes running on a cluster of computers.\nFigure 1.8 Kubernetes is to a computer cluster what an Operating System is to a computer\n\nJust as an operating system supports the basic functions of a computer, such as scheduling processes onto its CPUs and acting as an interface between the application and the computer’s hardware, Kubernetes schedules the components of a distributed application onto individual computers in the underlying computer cluster and acts as an interface between the application and the cluster.\nIt frees application developers from the need to implement infrastructure-related mechanisms in their applications; instead, they rely on Kubernetes to provide them. This includes things like:\n\nservice discovery - a mechanism that allows applications to find other applications and use the services they provide,\nhorizontal scaling - replicating your application to adjust to fluctuations in load,\nload-balancing - distributing load across all the application replicas,\nself-healing - keeping the system healthy by automatically restarting failed applications and moving them to healthy nodes after their nodes fail,\nleader election - a mechanism that decides which instance of the application should be active while the others remain idle but ready to take over if the active instance fails.\n\n\nBy relying on Kubernetes to provide these features, application developers can focus on implementing the core business logic instead of wasting time integrating applications with the infrastructure.\nHow Kubernetes fits into a computer cluster\nTo get a concrete example of how Kubernetes is deployed onto a cluster of computers, look at the following figure.\nFigure 1.9 Computers in a Kubernetes cluster are divided into the Control Plane and the Workload Plane\n\nYou start with a fleet of machines that you divide into two groups - the master and the worker nodes. The master nodes will run the Kubernetes Control Plane, which represents the brain of your system and controls the cluster, while the rest will run your applications - your workloads - and will therefore represent the Workload Plane.\nNOTE\nThe Workload Plane is sometimes referred to as the Data Plane, but this term could be confusing because the plane doesn’t host data but applications. Don’t be confused by the term “plane” either - in this context you can think of it as the “surface” the applications run on.\n\nNon-production clusters can use a single master node, but highly available clusters use at least three physical master nodes to host the Control Plane. The number of worker nodes depends on the number of applications you’ll deploy.\nHow all cluster nodes become one large deployment area\nAfter Kubernetes is installed on the computers, you no longer need to think about individual computers when deploying applications. Regardless of the number of worker nodes in your cluster, they all become a single space where you deploy your applications. You do this using the Kubernetes API, which is provided by the Kubernetes Control Plane.\nFigure 1.10 Kubernetes exposes the cluster as a uniform deployment area\n\nWhen I say that all worker nodes become one space, I don’t want you to think that you can deploy an extremely large application that is spread across several small machines. Kubernetes doesn’t do magic tricks like this. Each application must be small enough to fit on one of the worker nodes.\nWhat I meant was that when deploying applications, it doesn’t matter which worker node they end up on. Kubernetes may later even move the application from one node to another. You may not even notice when that happens, and you shouldn’t care.\nThe benefits of using Kubernetes\nYou’ve already learned why many organizations across the world have welcomed Kubernetes into their data centers. Now, let’s take a closer look at the specific benefits it brings to both development and IT operations teams.\nSelf-service deployment of applications\nBecause Kubernetes presents all its worker nodes as a single deployment surface, it no longer matters which node you deploy your application to. This means that developers can now deploy applications on their own, even if they don’t know anything about the number of nodes or the characteristics of each node.\nIn the past, the system administrators were the ones who decided where each application should be placed. This task is now left to Kubernetes. This allows a developer to deploy applications without having to rely on other people to do so. When a developer deploys an application, Kubernetes chooses the best node on which to run the application based on the resource requirements of the application and the resources available on each node.\nReducing costs via better infrastructure utilization\nIf you don’t care which node your application lands on, it also means that it can be moved to any other node at any time without you having to worry about it. Kubernetes may need to do this to make room for a larger application that someone wants to deploy. This ability to move applications allows the applications to be packed tightly together so that the resources of the nodes can be utilized in the best possible way.\nNOTE\nIn chapter 17 you’ll learn more about how Kubernetes decides where to place each application and how you can influence the decision.\n\nFinding optimal combinations can be challenging and time consuming, especially when the number of all possible options is huge, such as when you have many application components and many server nodes on which they can be deployed. Computers can perform this task much better and faster than humans. Kubernetes does it very well. By combining different applications on the same machines, Kubernetes improves the utilization of your hardware infrastructure so you can run more applications on fewer servers.\nAutomatically adjusting to changing load\nUsing Kubernetes to manage your deployed applications also means that the operations team doesn’t have to constantly monitor the load of each application to respond to sudden load peaks. Kubernetes takes care of this also. It can monitor the resources consumed by each application and other metrics and adjust the number of running instances of each application to cope with increased load or resource usage.\nWhen you run Kubernetes on cloud infrastructure, it can even increase the size of your cluster by provisioning additional nodes through the cloud provider’s API. This way, you never run out of space to run additional instances of your applications.\nKeeping applications running smoothly\nKubernetes also makes every effort to ensure that your applications run smoothly. If your application crashes, Kubernetes will restart it automatically. So even if you have a broken application that runs out of memory after running for more than a few hours, Kubernetes will ensure that your application continues to provide the service to its users by automatically restarting it in this case.\nKubernetes is a self-healing system in that it deals with software errors like the one just described, but it also handles hardware failures. As clusters grow in size, the frequency of node failure also increases. For example, in a cluster with one hundred nodes and a MTBF (mean-time-between-failure) of 100 days for each node, you can expect one node to fail every day.\nWhen a node fails, Kubernetes automatically moves applications to the remaining healthy nodes. The operations team no longer needs to manually move the application and can instead focus on repairing the node itself and returning it to the pool of available hardware resources.\nIf your infrastructure has enough free resources to allow normal system operation without the failed node, the operations team doesn’t even have to react immediately to the failure. If it occurs in the middle of the night, no one from the operations team even has to wake up. They can sleep peacefully and deal with the failed node during regular working hours.\nSimplifying application development\nThe improvements described in the previous section mainly concern application deployment. But what about the process of application development? Does Kubernetes bring anything to their table? It definitely does.\nAs mentioned previously, Kubernetes offers infrastructure-related services that would otherwise have to be implemented in your applications. This includes the discovery of services and/or peers in a distributed application, leader election, centralized application configuration and others. Kubernetes provides this while keeping the application Kubernetes-agnostic, but when required, applications can also query the Kubernetes API to obtain detailed information about their environment. They can also use the API to change the environment.\nThe architecture of a Kubernetes cluster\nAs you’ve already learned, a Kubernetes cluster consists of nodes divided into two groups:\n\nA set of master nodes that host the Control Plane components, which are the brains of the system, since they control the entire cluster.\nA set of worker nodes that form the Workload Plane, which is where your workloads (or applications) run.\n\nThe following figure shows the two planes and the different nodes they consist of.\nFigure 1.11 The two planes that make up a Kubernetes cluster\n\nThe two planes, and hence the two types of nodes, run different Kubernetes components. The next two sections of the book introduce them and summarize their functions without going into details. These components will be mentioned several times in the next part of the book where I explain the fundamental concepts of Kubernetes. An in-depth look at the components and their internals follows in the third part of the book.\nControl Plane components\nThe Control Plane is what controls the cluster. It consists of several components that run on a single master node or are replicated across multiple master nodes to ensure high availability. The Control Plane’s components are shown in the following figure.\nFigure 1.12 The components of the Kubernetes Control Plane\n\nThese are the components and their functions:\n\nThe Kubernetes API Server exposes the RESTful Kubernetes API. Engineers using the cluster and other Kubernetes components create objects via this API.\nThe etcd distributed datastore persists the objects you create through the API, since the API Server itself is stateless. The Server is the only component that talks to etcd.\nThe Scheduler decides on which worker node each application instance should run.\nControllers bring to life the objects you create through the API. Most of them simply create other objects, but some also communicate with external systems (for example, the cloud provider via its API).\n\nThe components of the Control Plane hold and control the state of the cluster, but they don’t run your applications. This is done by the (worker) nodes.\nWorker node components\nThe worker nodes are the computers on which your applications run. They form the cluster’s Workload Plane. In addition to applications, several Kubernetes components also run on these nodes. They perform the task of running, monitoring and providing connectivity between your applications. They are shown in the following figure.\nFigure 1.13 The Kubernetes components that run on each node\n\nEach node runs the following set of components:\n\nThe Kubelet, an agent that talks to the API server and manages the applications running on its node. It reports the status of these applications and the node via the API.\nThe Container Runtime, which can be Docker or any other runtime compatible with Kubernetes. It runs your applications in containers as instructed by the Kubelet.\nThe Kubernetes Service Proxy (Kube Proxy) load-balances network traffic between applications. Its name suggests that traffic flows through it, but that’s no longer the case. You’ll learn why in chapter 14.\n\nAdd-on components\nMost Kubernetes clusters also contain several other components. This includes a DNS server, network plugins, logging agents and many others. They typically run on the worker nodes but can also be configured to run on the master.\nGaining a deeper understanding of the architecture\nFor now, I only expect you to be vaguely familiar with the names of these components and their function, as I’ll mention them many times throughout the following chapters. You’ll learn snippets about them in these chapters, but I’ll explain them in more detail in chapter 14.\nI’m not a fan of explaining how things work until I first explain what something does and teach you how to use it. It’s like learning to drive. You don’t want to know what’s under the hood. At first, you just want to learn how to get from point A to B. Only then will you be interested in how the car makes this possible. Knowing what’s under the hood may one day help you get your car moving again after it has broken down and you are stranded on the side of the road. I hate to say it, but you’ll have many moments like this when dealing with Kubernetes due to its sheer complexity.\nHow Kubernetes runs an application\nWith a general overview of the components that make up Kubernetes, I can finally explain how to deploy an application in Kubernetes.\nDefining your application\nEverything in Kubernetes is represented by an object. You create and retrieve these objects via the Kubernetes API. Your application consists of several types of these objects - one type represents the application deployment as a whole, another represents a running instance of your application, another represents the service provided by a set of these instances and allows reaching them at a single IP address, and there are many others.\nAll these types are explained in detail in the second part of the book. At the moment, it’s enough to know that you define your application through several types of objects. These objects are usually defined in one or more manifest files in either YAML or JSON format.\nDEFINITION\nYAML was initially said to mean “Yet Another Markup Language”, but it was latter changed to the recursive acronym “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. It’s one of the ways to serialize an object into a human-readable text file.\n\nDEFINITION\nJSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation. It’s a different way of serializing an object, but more suitable for exchanging data between applications.\n\nThe following figure shows an example of deploying an application by creating a manifest with two deployments exposed using two services.\nFigure 1.14 Deploying an application to Kubernetes\n\nThese actions take place when you deploy the application:\n\nYou submit the application manifest to the Kubernetes API. The API Server writes the objects defined in the manifest to etcd.\nA controller notices the newly created objects and creates several new objects - one for each application instance.\nThe Scheduler assigns a node to each instance.\nThe Kubelet notices that an instance is assigned to the Kubelet’s node. It runs the application instance via the Container Runtime.\nThe Kube Proxy notices that the application instances are ready to accept connections from clients and configures a load balancer for them.\nThe Kubelets and the Controllers monitor the system and keep the applications running.\n\nThe procedure is explained in more detail in the following sections, but the complete explanation is given in chapter 14, after you have familiarized yourself with all the objects and controllers involved.\nSubmitting the application to the API\nAfter you’ve created your YAML or JSON file(s), you submit the file to the API, usually via the Kubernetes command-line tool called kubectl.\nNOTE\nKubectl is pronounced kube-control, but the softer souls in the community prefer to call it kube-cuddle. Some refer to it as kube-C-T-L.\n\nKubectl splits the file into individual objects and creates each of them by sending an HTTP PUT or POST request to the API, as is usually the case with RESTful APIs. The API Server validates the objects and stores them in the etcd datastore. In addition, it notifies all interested components that these objects have been created. Controllers, which are explained next, are one of these components.\nAbout the controllers\nMost object types have an associated controller. A controller is interested in a particular object type. It waits for the API server to notify it that a new object has been created, and then performs operations to bring that object to life. Typically, the controller just creates other objects via the same Kubernetes API. For example, the controller responsible for application deployments creates one or more objects that represent individual instances of the application. The number of objects created by the controller depends on the number of replicas specified in the application deployment object.\nAbout the Scheduler\nThe scheduler is a special type of controller, whose only task is to schedule application instances onto worker nodes. It selects the best worker node for each new application instance object and assigns it to the instance - by modifying the object via the API.\nAbout the Kubelet and the Container Runtime\nThe Kubelet that runs on each worker node is also a type of controller. Its task is to wait for application instances to be assigned to the node on which it is located and run the application. This is done by instructing the Container Runtime to start the application’s container.\nAbout the Kube Proxy\nBecause an application deployment can consist of multiple application instances, a load balancer is required to expose them at a single IP address. The Kube Proxy, another controller running alongside the Kubelet, is responsible for setting up the load balancer.\nKeeping the applications healthy\nOnce the application is up and running, the Kubelet keeps the application healthy by restarting it when it terminates. It also reports the status of the application by updating the object that represents the application instance. The other controllers monitor these objects and ensure that applications are moved to healthy nodes if their nodes fail.\nYou’re now roughly familiar with the architecture and functionality of Kubernetes. You don’t need to understand or remember all the details at this moment, because internalizing this information will be easier when you learn about each individual object types and the controllers that bring them to life in the second part of the book.\n"},"docs/Introducing_Kubernetes_into_your_organization.html":{"url":"docs/Introducing_Kubernetes_into_your_organization.html","title":"1.3 Introducing Kubernetes into your organization","keywords":"","body":"1.3 Introducing Kubernetes into your organization\nTo close this chapter, let’s see what options are available to you if you decide to introduce Kubernetes in your own IT environment.\nRunning Kubernetes on-premises and in the cloud\nIf you want to run your applications on Kubernetes, you have to decide whether you want to run them locally, in your organization’s own infrastructure (on-premises) or with one of the major cloud providers, or perhaps both - in a hybrid cloud solution.\nRunning Kubernetes on-premises\nRunning Kubernetes on your own infrastructure may be your only option if regulations require you to run applications on site. This usually means that you’ll have to manage Kubernetes yourself, but we’ll come to that later.\nKubernetes can run directly on your bare-metal machines or in virtual machines running in your data center. In either case, you won’t be able to scale your cluster as easily as when you run it in virtual machines provided by a cloud provider.\nDeploying Kubernetes in the cloud\nIf you have no on-premises infrastructure, you have no choice but to run Kubernetes in the cloud. This has the advantage that you can scale your cluster at any time at short notice if required. As mentioned earlier, Kubernetes itself can ask the cloud provider to provision additional virtual machines when the current size of the cluster is no longer sufficient to run all the applications you want to deploy.\nWhen the number of workloads decreases and some worker nodes are left without running workloads, Kubernetes can ask the cloud provider to destroy the virtual machines of these nodes to reduce your operational costs. This elasticity of the cluster is certainly one of the main benefits of running Kubernetes in the cloud.\nUsing a hybrid cloud solution\nA more complex option is to run Kubernetes on-premises, but also allow it to spill over into the cloud. It’s possible to configure Kubernetes to provision additional nodes in the cloud if you exceed the capacity of your own data center. This way, you get the best of both worlds. Most of the time, your applications run locally without the cost of virtual machine rental, but in short periods of peak load that may occur only a few times a year, your applications can handle the extra load by using the additional resources in the cloud.\nIf your use-case requires it, you can also run a Kubernetes cluster across multiple cloud providers or a combination of any of the options mentioned. This can be done using a single control plane or one control plane in each location.\nTo manage or not to manage Kubernetes yourself\nIf you are considering introducing Kubernetes in your organization, the most important question you need to answer is whether you’ll manage Kubernetes yourself or use a Kubernetes-as-a-Service type offering where someone else manages it for you.\nManaging Kubernetes yourself\nIf you already run applications on-premises and have enough hardware to run a production-ready Kubernetes cluster, your first instinct is probably to deploy and manage it yourself. If you ask anyone in the Kubernetes community if this is a good idea, you’ll usually get a very definite “no”.\nFigure 1.14 was a very simplified representation of what happens in a Kubernetes cluster when you deploy an application. Even that figure should have scared you. Kubernetes brings with it an enormous amount of additional complexity. Anyone who wants to run a Kubernetes cluster must be intimately familiar with its inner workings.\nThe management of production-ready Kubernetes clusters is a multi-billion-dollar industry. Before you decide to manage one yourself, it’s essential that you consult with engineers who have already done it to learn about the issues most teams run into. If you don’t, you may be setting yourself up for failure. On the other hand, trying out Kubernetes for non-production use-cases or using a managed Kubernetes cluster is much less problematic.\nUsing a managed Kubernetes cluster in the cloud\nUsing Kubernetes is ten times easier than managing it. Most major cloud providers now offer Kubernetes-as-a-Service. They take care of managing Kubernetes and its components while you simply use the Kubernetes API like any of the other APIs the cloud provider offers.\nThe top managed Kubernetes offerings include the following:\n\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\nAzure Kubernetes Service (AKS)\nAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)\nIBM Cloud Kubernetes Service\nRed Hat OpenShift Online and Dedicated\nVMware Cloud PKS\nAlibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK)\n\nThe first half of this book focuses on just using Kubernetes. You’ll run the exercises in a local development cluster and on a managed GKE cluster, as I find it’s the easiest to use and offers the best user experience. The second part of the book gives you a solid foundation for managing Kubernetes, but to truly master it, you’ll need to gain additional experience.\nUsing vanilla or extended Kubernetes\nThe final question is whether to use a vanilla open-source version of Kubernetes or an extended, enterprise-quality Kubernetes product.\nUsing a vanilla version of Kubernetes\nThe open-source version of Kubernetes is maintained by the community and represents the cutting edge of Kubernetes development. This also means that it may not be as stable as the other options. It may also lack good security defaults. Deploying the vanilla version requires a lot of fine tuning to set everything up for production use.\nUsing enterprise-grade Kubernetes distributions\nA better option for using Kubernetes in production is to use an enterprise-quality Kubernetes distribution such as OpenShift or Rancher. In addition to the increased security and performance provided by better defaults, they offer additional object types in addition to those provided in the upstream Kubernetes API. For example, vanilla Kubernetes does not contain object types that represent cluster users, whereas commercial distributions do. They also provide additional software tools for deploying and managing well-known third-party applications on Kubernetes.\nOf course, extending and hardening Kubernetes takes time, so these commercial Kubernetes distributions usually lag one or two versions behind the upstream version of Kubernetes. It’s not as bad as it sounds. The benefits usually outweigh the disadvantages.\nShould you even use Kubernetes?\nI hope this chapter has made you excited about Kubernetes and you can’t wait to squeeze it into your IT stack. But to close this chapter properly, we need to say a word or two about when introducing Kubernetes is not a good idea.\nDo your workloads require automated management?\nThe first thing you need to be honest about is whether you need to automate the management of your applications at all. If your application is a large monolith, you definitely don’t need Kubernetes.\nEven if you deploy microservices, using Kubernetes may not be the best option, especially if the number of your microservices is very small. It’s difficult to provide an exact number when the scales tip over, since other factors also influence the decision. But if your system consists of less than five microservices, throwing Kubernetes into the mix is probably not a good idea. If your system has more than twenty microservices, you will most likely benefit from the integration of Kubernetes. If the number of your microservices falls somewhere in between, other factors, such as the ones described next, should be considered.\nCan you afford to invest your engineers’ time into learning Kubernetes?\nKubernetes is designed to allow applications to run without them knowing that they are running in Kubernetes. While the applications themselves don’t need to be modified to run in Kubernetes, development engineers will inevitably spend a lot of time learning how to use Kubernetes, even though the operators are the only ones that actually need that knowledge.\nIt would be hard to tell your teams that you’re switching to Kubernetes and expect only the operations team to start exploring it. Developers like shiny new things. At the time of writing, Kubernetes is still a very shiny thing.\nAre you prepared for increased costs in the interim?\nWhile Kubernetes reduces long-term operational costs, introducing Kubernetes in your organization initially involves increased costs for training, hiring new engineers, building and purchasing new tools and possibly additional hardware. Kubernetes requires additional computing resources in addition to the resources that the applications use.\nDon’t believe the hype\nAlthough Kubernetes has been around for several years at the time of writing this book, I can’t say that the hype phase is over. The initial excitement has just begun to calm down, but many engineers may still be unable to make rational decisions about whether the integration of Kubernetes is as necessary as it seems.\n"},"docs/Summary_1.html":{"url":"docs/Summary_1.html","title":"1.4 Summary","keywords":"","body":"1.4 Summary\nIn this introductory chapter, you’ve learned that:\n\nKubernetes is Greek for helmsman.

Kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool, is pronounced kube-control.\nKubernetes is an open-source project built upon Google’s vast experience in running applications on a global scale. Thousands of individuals now contribute to it.\nKubernetes uses a declarative model to describe application deployments. After you provide a description of your application to Kubernetes, it brings it to life.\nKubernetes is like an operating system for the cluster. It abstracts the infrastructure and presents all computers in a data center as one large, contiguous deployment area.\nMicroservice-based applications are more difficult to manage than monolithic applications. The more microservices you have, the more you need to automate their management with a system like Kubernetes.\nKubernetes helps both development and operations teams to do what they do best. It frees them from mundane tasks and introduces a standard way of deploying applications both on-premises and in any cloud.\nUsing Kubernetes allows developers to deploy applications without the help of system administrators. It reduces operational costs through better utilization of existing hardware, automatically adjusts your system to load fluctuations, and heals itself and the applications running on it.\nA Kubernetes cluster consists of master and worker nodes. The master nodes run the Control Plane, which controls the entire cluster, while the worker nodes run the deployed applications or workloads, and therefore represent the Workload Plane.\nUsing Kubernetes is simple, but managing it is hard.

But as the microservices become smaller and their numbers start to grow, you may not be able to afford to give each one its own VM if you want to keep your hardware costs low and not waste resources.\nIt’s not just a matter of wasting hardware resources - each VM typically needs to be individually configured and managed, which means that running higher numbers of VMs also results in higher staffing requirements and the need for a better, often more complicated automation system. Due to the shift to microservice architectures, where systems consist of hundreds of deployed application instances, an alternative to VMs was needed. Containers are that alternative.\nComparing containers to virtual machines\nInstead of using virtual machines to isolate the environments of individual microservices (or software processes in general), most development and operations teams now prefer to use containers. They allow you to run multiple services on the same host computer, while keeping them isolated from each other. Like VMs, but with much less overhead.\nUnlike VMs, which each run a separate operating system with several system processes, a process running in a container runs within the existing host operating system. Because there is only one operating system, no duplicate system processes exist. Although all the application processes run in the same operating system, their environments are isolated, though not as well as when you run them in separate VMs. To the process in the container, this isolation makes it look like no other processes exist on the computer. You’ll learn how this is possible in the next few sections, but first let’s dive deeper into the differences between containers and virtual machines.\nComparing the overhead of containers and virtual machines\nCompared to VMs, containers are much lighter, because they don’t require a separate resource pool or any additional OS-level processes. While each VM  usually runs its own set of system processes, which requires additional computing resources in addition to those consumed by the user application’s own process, a container is nothing more than an isolated process running in the existing host OS that consumes only the resources the app consumes. They have virtually no overhead.\nFigure 2.1 shows two bare metal computers, one running two virtual machines, and the other running containers instead. The latter has space for additional containers, as it runs only one operating system, while the first runs three – one host and two guest OSes.\nFigure 2.1 Using VMs to isolate groups of applications vs. isolating individual apps with containers\n\nBecause of the resource overhead of VMs, you often group multiple applications into each VM. You can’t afford to dedicate a whole VM to each app. But containers introduce no overhead, which means you can afford to create a separate container for each application. In fact, you should never run multiple applications in the same container, as this makes managing the processes in the container much more difficult. Moreover, all existing software dealing with containers, including Kubernetes itself, is designed under the premise that there’s only one application in a container.\nComparing the start-up time of containers and virtual machines\nIn addition to the lower runtime overhead, containers also start the application faster, because only the application process itself needs to be started. No additional system processes need to be started first, as is the case when booting up a new virtual machine.\nComparing the isolation of containers and virtual machines\nYou’ll agree that containers are clearly better when it comes to the use of resources, but there’s also a disadvantage. When you run applications in virtual machines, each VM runs its own operating system and kernel. Underneath those VMs is the hypervisor (and possibly an additional operating system), which splits the physical hardware resources into smaller sets of virtual resources that the operating system in each VM can use. As figure 2.2 shows, applications running in these VMs make system calls (sys-calls) to the guest OS kernel in the VM, and the machine instructions that the kernel then executes on the virtual CPUs are then forwarded to the host’s physical CPU via the hypervisor.\nFigure 2.2 How apps use the hardware when running in a VM vs. in a container\n\nNOTE \n  Two types of hypervisors exist. Type 1 hypervisors don’t require running a host OS, while type 2 hypervisors do.\n\nContainers, on the other hand, all make system calls on the single kernel running in the host OS. This single kernel is the only one that executes instructions on the host’s CPU. The CPU doesn’t need to handle any kind of virtualization the way it does with VMs.\nExamine figure 2.3 to see the difference between running three applications on bare metal, running them in two separate virtual machines, or running them in three containers.\nFigure 2.3 The difference between running applications on bare metal, in virtual machines, and in containers\n\nIn the first case, all three applications use the same kernel and aren’t isolated at all. In the second case, applications A and B run in the same VM and thus share the kernel, while application C is completely isolated from the other two, since it uses its own kernel. It only shares the hardware with the first two.\nThe third case shows the same three applications running in containers. Although they all use the same kernel, they are isolated from each other and completely unaware of the others’ existence. The isolation is provided by the kernel itself. Each application sees only a part of the physical hardware and sees itself as the only process running in the OS, although they all run in the same OS.\nUnderstanding the security-implications of container isolation\nThe main advantage of using virtual machines over containers is the complete isolation they provide, since each VM has its own Linux kernel, while containers all use the same kernel. This can clearly pose a security risk. If there’s a bug in the kernel, an application in one container might use it to read the memory of applications in other containers. If the apps run in different VMs and therefore share only the hardware, the probability of such attacks is much lower. Of course, complete isolation is only achieved by running applications on separate physical machines.\nAdditionally, containers share memory space, whereas each VM uses its own chunk of memory. Therefore, if you don’t limit the amount of memory that a container can use, this could cause other containers to run out of memory or cause their data to be swapped out to disk.\nNOTE\nThis can’t happen in Kubernetes, because it requires that swap is disabled on all the nodes.\n\nUnderstanding what enables containers and what enables virtual machines\nWhile virtual machines are enabled through virtualization support in the CPU and by virtualization software on the host, containers are enabled by the Linux kernel itself. You’ll learn about container technologies later when you can try them out for yourself. You’ll need to have Docker installed for that, so let’s learn how it fits into the container story.\nIntroducing the Docker container platform\nWhile container technologies have existed for a long time, they only became widely known with the rise of Docker. Docker was the first container system that made them easily portable across different computers. It simplified the process of packaging up the application and all its libraries and other dependencies - even the entire OS file system - into a simple, portable package that can be used to deploy the application on any computer running Docker.\nIntroducing containers, images and registries\nDocker is a platform for packaging, distributing and running applications. As mentioned earlier, it allows you to package your application along with its entire environment. This can be just a few dynamically linked libraries required by the app, or all the files that are usually shipped with an operating system. Docker allows you to distribute this package via a public repository to any other Docker-enabled computer.\nFigure 2.4 The three main Docker concepts are images, registries and containers\n\n\nImages—A container image is something you package your application and its environment into. Like a zip file or a tarball. It contains the whole filesystem that the application will use and additional metadata, such as the path to the executable file to run when the image is executed, the ports the application listens on, and other information about the image.\n\nRegistries—A registry is a repository of container images that enables the exchange of images between different people and computers. After you build your image, you can either run it on the same computer, or push (upload) the image to a registry and then pull (download) it to another computer. Certain registries are public, allowing anyone to pull images from it, while others are private and only accessible to individuals, organizations or computers that have the required authentication credentials.\n\nContainers—A container is instantiated from a container image. A running container is a normal process running in the host operating system, but its environment is isolated from that of the host and the environments of other processes. The file system of the container originates from the container image, but additional file systems can also be mounted into the container. A container is usually resource-restricted, meaning it can only access and use the amount of resources such as CPU and memory that have been allocated to it.\n\n\nBuilding, distributing, and running a container image\nTo understand how containers, images and registries relate to each other, let’s look at how to build a container image, distribute it through a registry and create a running container from the image. These three processes are shown in figures 2.5 to 2.7.\n\nAs shown in figure 2.5, the developer first builds an image, and then pushes it to a registry, as shown in figure 2.6. The image is now available to anyone who can access the registry.\n\nAs the next figure shows, another person can now pull the image to any other computer running Docker and run it. Docker creates an isolated container based on the image and invokes the executable file specified in the image.\n\nRunning the application on any computer is made possible by the fact that the environment of the application is decoupled from the environment of the host.\nUnderstanding the environment that the application sees\nWhen you run an application in a container, it sees exactly the file system content you bundled into the container image, as well as any additional file systems you mount into the container. The application sees the same files whether it’s running on your laptop or a full-fledged production server, even if the production server uses a completely different Linux distribution. The application typically has no access to the files in the host’s operating system, so it doesn’t matter if the server has a completely different set of installed libraries than your development computer.\nFor example, if you package your application with the files of the entire Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system and then run it, the application will think it’s running inside RHEL, whether you run it on your Fedora-based or a Debian-based computer. The Linux distribution installed on the host is irrelevant. The only thing that might be important is the kernel version and the kernel modules it loads. Later, I’ll explain why.\nThis is similar to creating a VM image by creating a new VM, installing an operating system and your app in it, and then distributing the whole VM image so that other people can run it on different hosts. Docker achieves the same effect, but instead of using VMs for app isolation, it uses Linux container technologies to achieve (almost) the same level of isolation.\nUnderstanding image layers\nUnlike virtual machine images, which are big blobs of the entire filesystem required by the operating system installed in the VM, container images consist of layers that are usually much smaller. These layers can be shared and reused across multiple images. This means that only certain layers of an image need to be downloaded if the rest were already downloaded to the host as part of another image containing the same layers.\nLayers make image distribution very efficient but also help to reduce the storage footprint of images. Docker stores each layer only once. As you can see in figure 2.8, two containers created from two images that contain the same layers use the same files.\n\nThe figure shows that containers A and B share an image layer, which means that applications A and B read some of the same files. In addition, they also share the underlying layer with container C. But if all three containers have access to the same files, how can they be completely isolated from each other? Are changes that application A makes to a file stored in the shared layer not visible to application B? They aren’t. Here’s why.\nThe filesystems are isolated by the Copy-on-Write (CoW) mechanism. The filesystem of a container consists of read-only layers from the container image and an additional read/write layer stacked on top. When an application running in container A changes a file in one of the read-only layers, the entire file is copied into the container’s read/write layer and the file contents are changed there. Since each container has its own writable layer, changes to shared files are not visible in any other container.\nWhen you delete a file, it is only marked as deleted in the read/write layer, but it’s still present in one or more of the layers below. What follows is that deleting files never reduces the size of the image.\nWARNING\n  Even seemingly harmless operations such as changing permissions or ownership of a file result in a new copy of the entire file being created in the read/write layer. If you perform this type of operation on a large file or many files, the image size may swell significantly.\n\nUnderstanding the portability limitations of container images\nIn theory, a Docker-based container image can be run on any Linux computer running Docker, but one small caveat exists, because containers don’t have their own kernel. If a containerized application requires a particular kernel version, it may not work on every computer. If a computer is running a different version of the Linux kernel or doesn’t load the required kernel modules, the app can’t run on it. This scenario is illustrated in the following figure.\n\nContainer B requires a specific kernel module to run properly. This module is loaded in the kernel in the first computer, but not in the second. You can run the container image on the second computer, but it will break when it tries to use the missing module.\nAnd it’s not just about the kernel and its modules. It should also be clear that a containerized app built for a specific hardware architecture can only run on computers with the same architecture. You can’t put an application compiled for the x86 CPU architecture into a container and expect to run it on an ARM-based computer just because Docker is available there. For this you would need a VM to emulate the x86 architecture.\nIntroducing Docker alternatives and the Open Container Initiative\nDocker was the first container platform to make containers mainstream. I hope I’ve made it clear that Docker itself doesn’t provide process isolation. The actual isolation of containers takes place at the Linux kernel level using the mechanisms it provides. Docker just makes it easy to use these mechanisms and allows you to distribute container images to different hosts.\nIntroducing the Open Container Initiative (OCI)\nAfter the success of Docker, the Open Container Initiative (OCI) was born to create open industry standards around container formats and runtime. Docker is part of this initiative, as are other container runtimes and a number of organizations with interest in container technologies.\nOCI members created the OCI Image Format Specification, which prescribes a standard format for container images, and the OCI Runtime Specification, which defines a standard interface for container runtimes with the aim of standardizing the creation, configuration and execution of containers.\nIntroducing the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) and its implementation (CRI-O)\nThis book focuses on using Docker as the container runtime for Kubernetes, as it was initially the only one supported by Kubernetes and is still the most widely used. But Kubernetes now supports many other container runtimes through the Container Runtime Interface (CRI).\nOne implementation of CRI is CRI-O, a lightweight alternative to Docker that allows you to leverage any OCI-compliant container runtime with Kubernetes. Examples of OCI-compliant runtimes include rkt (pronounced Rocket), runC, and Kata Containers.\n"},"docs/Exploring_containers_hands-on.html":{"url":"docs/Exploring_containers_hands-on.html","title":"2.2 Exploring containers hands-on","keywords":"","body":"2.2 Exploring containers hands-on\nYou now have a feel for what containers are, but I have yet to explain how they work. Before we get to that, you need to create an application, package it into a container image and run it. You’ll need Docker, so let’s install it and run a Hello world container first.\nInstalling Docker and running a Hello World container\nIdeally, you’ll install Docker directly on a Linux computer, so you won’t have to deal with the additional complexity of running containers inside a VM running within your host OS. But, if you’re using macOS or Windows and don’t know how to set up a Linux VM, the Docker Desktop application will set it up for you. The Docker command-line (CLI) tool that you’ll use to run containers will be installed in your host OS, but the Docker daemon will run inside the VM, as will all the containers it creates.\nThe Docker Platform consists of many components, but you only need to install Docker Engine to run containers. If you use macOS or Windows, install Docker Desktop. For details, follow the instructions at http://docs.docker.com/install.\nNOTE\nDocker Desktop for Windows can run either Windows or Linux containers. Make sure that you configure it to use Linux containers.\n\nRunning a Hello World container\nAfter the installation is complete, you use the docker CLI tool to run docker commands. First, let’s try pulling and running an existing image from Docker Hub, the public image registry that contains ready-to-use container images for many well-known software packages. One of them is the busybox image, which you’ll use to run a simple echo \"Hello world\" command in your first container.\nIf you’re unfamiliar with busybox, it’s a single executable file that combines many of the standard UNIX command-line tools, such as echo, ls, gzip, and so on. Instead of the busybox image, you could also use any other full-fledged OS container image like Fedora, Ubuntu, or any other image that contains the echo executable file.\nYou don’t need to download or install anything to run the busybox image. You can do everything with a single docker run command, by specifying the image to download and the command to run in it. To run the simple Hello world container, execute the command shown in the following listing.\nListing 2.1 Running a Hello World container with Docker\n$ docker run busybox echo \"Hello World\"\nUnable to find image 'busybox:latest' locally\nlatest: Pulling from library/busybox\n7c9d20b9b6cd: Pull complete\nDigest: sha256:fe301db49df08c384001ed752dff6d52b4…\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for busybox:latest\nHello World\n\nThis doesn’t look too impressive, but keep in mind that the entire “application” was downloaded and executed with a single command, without you having to install that application or any of its dependencies.\nIn your case, the app was just a single executable file, but it could have been an incredibly complex app with dozens of libraries and additional files. The entire process of setting up and running the app would be the same. What isn’t obvious is that the app ran in a container, isolated from the other processes on the computer. You’ll see that this is true in the exercises that follow.\nUnderstanding what happens when you run a container\nFigure 2.10 shows exactly what happened when you executed the docker run command.\n\nThe docker CLI tool sent an instruction to run the container to the Docker daemon, which checked whether the busybox image was already present in its local image cache. It wasn’t, so it pulled it from the Docker Hub registry.\nAfter downloading the image to your computer, the Docker daemon created a container from that image and executed the echo command in it. The command printed the text to the standard output, the process then terminated and the container stopped.\nIf your local computer runs a Linux OS, the Docker CLI tool and the daemon both run in this OS. If it runs macOS or Windows, the daemon and the containers run in the Linux VM.\nRunning other images\nRunning other existing container images is much the same as running the busybox image. In fact, it’s often even simpler, since you don’t normally need to specify what command to execute, as with the echo command in the previous example. The command that should be executed is usually written in the image itself, but you can override it when you run it.\nFor example, if you want to run the Redis datastore, you can find the image name on http://hub.docker.com or another public registry. In the case of Redis, one of the images is called redis:alpine, so you’d run it like this:\n$ docker run redis:alpine\n\nTo stop and exit the container, press Control-C (or Command-C on a Mac).\nNOTE\nIf you want to run an image from a different registry, you must specify the registry along with the image name. For example, if you want to run an image from the Quay.io registry, which is another publicly accessible image registry, run it as follows: docker run quay.io/some/image.\n\nUnderstanding image tags\nIf you’ve searched for the Redis image on Docker Hub, you’ve noticed that there are many image tags you can choose from. For Redis, the tags are latest, buster, alpine, but also 5.0.7-buster, 5.0.7-alpine, and so on.\nDocker allows you to have multiple versions or variants of the same image under the same name. Each variant has a unique tag. If you refer to images without explicitly specifying the tag, Docker assumes that you’re referring to the special latest tag. When uploading a new version of an image, image authors usually tag it with both the actual version number and with latest. When you want to run the latest version of an image, use the latest tag instead of specifying the version.\nNOTE\nThe docker run command only pulls the image if it hasn’t already pulled it before. Using the latest tag ensures that you get the latest version when you first run the image. The locally cached image is used from that point on.\n\nEven for a single version, there are usually several variants of an image. For Redis I mentioned 5.0.7-buster and 5.0.7-alpine. They both contain the same version of Redis, but differ in the base image they are built on. 5.0.7-buster is based on Debian version “Buster”, while 5.0.7-alpine is based on the Alpine Linux base image, a very stripped-down image that is only 5MB in total – it contains only a small set of the installed binaries you see in a typical Linux distribution.\nTo run a specific version and/or variant of the image, specify the tag in the image name. For example, to run the 5.0.7-alpine tag, you’d execute the following command:\n$ docker run redis:5.0.7-alpine\nCreating a containerized Node.js web application\nNow that you have a working Docker setup, you’ll create an app that you’ll use throughout the book. You’ll create a trivial Node.js web application and package it into a container image. The application will accept HTTP requests and respond with the hostname of the computer it’s running on.\nThis way, you’ll see that an app running in a container sees a different hostname and not that of the host computer, even though it runs on the host like any other process. This will be useful later, when you deploy the app on Kubernetes and scale it out (scale it horizontally; that is, run multiple instances of the app). You’ll see your HTTP requests hitting different instances of the app.\nThe app consists of a single file called app.js whose contents are shown in the next listing.\nListing 2.2 A simple Node.js web application: app.js\nconst http = require('http');\nconst os = require('os');\n\nconst listenPort = 8080;\n\nconsole.log(\"Kubia server starting...\");\nconsole.log(\"Local hostname is \" + os.hostname());\nconsole.log(\"Listening on port \" + listenPort);\n\nvar handler = function(request, response) {\n  let clientIP = request.connection.remoteAddress;\n  console.log(\"Received request for \"+request.url+\" from \"+clientIP);\n  response.writeHead(200);\n  response.write(\"Hey there, this is \"+os.hostname()+\". \");\n  response.write(\"Your IP is \"+clientIP+\". \");\n  response.end(\"\\n\");\n};\n\nvar server = http.createServer(handler);\nserver.listen(listenPort);\n\nThe code in the listing should be easy to understand. It starts an HTTP server on port 8080. For each request, it logs the request information to standard output and sends a response with status code 200 OK and the following text:\nHey there, this is . Your IP is .\nNOTE \nThe hostname in the response is the server’s actual hostname, not the one sent by the client in the request’s Host header. This detail will be important later.\n\nYou could now download and install Node.js locally and test your app directly, but that’s not necessary. It’s easier to package it into a container image and run it with Docker. This enables you to run the app on any other Docker-enabled host without installing Node.js there either.\nCreating a Dockerfile to build the container image\nTo package your app into an image, you must first create a file called Dockerfile, which contains a list of instructions that Docker should perform when building the image. Create the file in the same directory as the app.js file and make sure it contains the three directives in the following listing.\nListing 2.3 A minimal Dockerfile for building a container image for your app\nFROM node:12\nADD app.js /app.js\nENTRYPOINT [\"node\", \"app.js\"]\n\nThe FROM line defines the container image that you’ll use as the starting point (the base image you’re building on top of). In your case, you use the node container image, tag 12. In the second line, you add the app.js file from your local directory into the root directory of the image, under the same name (app.js). Finally, in the third line, you specify the command that Docker should run when you execute the image. In your case, the command is node app.js.\nChoosing a base image\n\nYou may wonder why use this specific image as your base. Because your app is a Node.js app, you need your image to contain the node binary file to run the app. You could have used any image containing this binary, or you could have even used a Linux distribution base image such as fedora or ubuntu and installed Node.js into the container when building the image. But since the node image already contains everything needed to run Node.js apps, it doesn’t make sense to build the image from scratch. In some organizations, however, the use of a specific base image and adding software to it at build-time may be mandatory.\nBuilding the container image\nThe Dockerfile and the app.js file are everything you need to build your image. You’ll now build the image named kubia:latest using the command in the next listing:\nListing 2.4 Building the image\n$ docker build -t kubia:latest .\nSending build context to Docker daemon  3.072kB\nStep 1/3 : FROM node:12\n12: Pulling from library/node      \n092586df9206: Pull complete\nef599477fae0: Pull complete\n…\n89e674ac3af7: Pull complete\n08df71ec9bb0: Pull complete\nDigest: sha256:a919d679dd773a56acce15afa0f436055c9b9f20e1f28b4469a4bee69e0…\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for node:12\n ---> e498dabfee1c\nStep 2/3 : ADD app.js /app.js\n ---> 28d67701d6d9\nStep 3/3 : ENTRYPOINT [\"node\", \"app.js\"]\n ---> Running in a01d42eda116\nRemoving intermediate container a01d42eda116\n ---> b0ecc49d7a1d\nSuccessfully built b0ecc49d7a1d\nSuccessfully tagged kubia:latest\n\nThe -t option specifies the desired image name and tag and the dot at the end specifies the path to the directory that contains the Dockerfile and the build context (all artefacts needed by the build process).\nWhen the build process is complete, the newly created image is available in your computer’s local image store. You can see it by listing local images, as in the following listing.\nListing 2.5 Listing locally stored images\n$ docker images\nREPOSITORY   TAG      IMAGE ID           CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE\nkubia        latest   b0ecc49d7a1d       1 minute ago        908 MB\n…\n\nUnderstanding how the image was built\nFigure 2.11 shows what happens during the build process. You tell Docker to build an image called kubia based on the contents of the current directory. Docker reads the Dockerfile in the directory and builds the image based on the directives in the file.\n\nThe build itself isn’t performed by the docker CLI tool. Instead, the contents of the entire directory are uploaded to the Docker daemon and the image is built by it. You’ve already learned that the CLI tool and the daemon aren’t necessarily on the same computer. If you’re using Docker on a non-Linux system such as macOS or Windows, the client is in your host OS, but the daemon runs inside a Linux VM. But it could also run on a remote computer.\nTIP\nDon’t add unnecessary files to the build directory, as they will slow down the build process—especially if the Docker daemon is located on a remote system.\n\nTo build the image, Docker first pulls the base image (node:12) from the public image repository (Docker Hub in this case), unless the image is already stored locally. It then creates a new container from the image and executes the next directive from the Dockerfile. The container’s final state yields a new image with its own ID. The build process continues by processing the remaining directives in the Dockerfile. Each one creates a new image. The final image is then tagged with the tag you specified with the -t flag in the docker build command.\nUnderstanding what the layers in the image are\nSome pages ago, you learned that images consist of several layers. One might think that each image consists of only the layers of the base image and a single new layer on top, but that’s not the case. When building an image, a new layer is created for each individual directive in the Dockerfile.\nDuring the build of the kubia image, after it pulls all the layers of the base image, Docker creates a new layer and adds the app.js file into it. It then creates yet another layer that holds just the command to run when the image is executed. This last layer is then tagged as kubia:latest.\nYou can see the layers of an image and their size by running docker history, as shown in the following listing. The top layers are printed first.\nListing 2.6 Displaying the layers of a container image\n$ docker history kubia:latest\nIMAGE         CREATED     CREATED BY                          SIZE\nb0ecc49d7a1d  7 min ago   /bin/sh -c #(nop) ENTRYPOINT [\"node\"…   0B\n28d67701d6d9  7 min ago   /bin/sh -c #(nop) ADD file:2ed5d7753…   367B\ne498dabfee1c  2 days ago  /bin/sh -c #(nop) CMD [\"node\"]          0B\n     2 days ago  /bin/sh -c #(nop) ENTRYPOINT [\"docke…   0B\n     2 days ago  /bin/sh -c #(nop) COPY file:23873730…   116B\n     2 days ago  /bin/sh -c set -ex && for key in 6A0…   5.4MB\n     2 days ago  /bin/sh -c #(nop)  ENV YARN_VERSION=…   0B\n     2 days ago  /bin/sh -c ARCH= && dpkgArch=\"$(dpkg…   67MB\n     2 days ago  /bin/sh -c #(nop)  ENV NODE_VERSION=…   0B\n     3 weeks ago /bin/sh -c groupadd --gid 1000 node …   333kB\n     3 weeks ago /bin/sh -c set -ex;  apt-get update;…   562MB\n     3 weeks ago /bin/sh -c apt-get update && apt-get…   142MB\n     3 weeks ago /bin/sh -c set -ex;  if ! command -v…   7.8MB\n     3 weeks ago /bin/sh -c apt-get update && apt-get…   23.2MB\n     3 weeks ago /bin/sh -c #(nop)  CMD [\"bash\"]         0B\n     3 weeks ago /bin/sh -c #(nop) ADD file:9788b61de…   101MB\n\nMost of the layers you see come from the node:12 image (they also include layers of that image’s own base image). The two uppermost layers correspond to the second and third directives in the Dockerfile (ADD and ENTRYPOINT).\nAs you can see in the CREATED BY column, each layer is created by executing a command in the container. In addition to adding files with the ADD directive, you can also use other directives in the Dockerfile. For example, the RUN directive executes a command in the container during the build. In the listing above, you’ll find a layer where the apt-get update and some additional apt-get commands were executed. apt-get is part of the Ubuntu package manager used to install software packages. The command shown in the listing installs some packages onto the image’s filesystem.\nTo learn about RUN and other directives you can use in a Dockerfile, refer to the Dockerfile reference at https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/].\nTIP\nEach directive creates a new layer. I have already mentioned that when you delete a file, it is only marked as deleted in the new layer and is not removed from the layers below. Therefore, deleting a file with a subsequent directive won’t reduce the size of the image. If you use the RUN directive, make sure that the command it executes deletes all temporary files it creates before it terminates.\n\nRunning the container image\nWith the image built and ready, you can now run the container with the following command:\n$ docker run --name kubia-container -p 1234:8080 -d kubia\n9d62e8a9c37e056a82bb1efad57789e947df58669f94adc2006c087a03c54e02\n\nThis tells Docker to run a new container called kubia-container from the kubia image. The container is detached from the console (-d flag) and runs in the background. Port 1234 on the host computer is mapped to port 8080 in the container (specified by the -p 1234:8080 option), so you can access the app at http://localhost:1234.\nThe following figure should help you visualize how everything fits together. Note that the Linux VM exists only if you use macOS or Windows. If you use Linux directly, there is no VM and the box depicting port 1234 is at the edge of the local computer.\n\nAccessing your app\nNow access the application at http://localhost:1234 using curl or your internet browser:\n$ curl localhost:1234\nHey there, this is 44d76963e8e1. Your IP is ::ffff:172.17.0.1.\n\nNOTE\nIf the Docker Daemon runs on a different machine, you must replace localhost with the IP of that machine. You can look it up in the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.\n\nIf all went well, you should see the response sent by the application. In my case, it returns 44d76963e8e1 as its hostname. In your case, you’ll see a different hexadecimal number. This is the ID of the container that is displayed when you list them.\nListing all running containers\nTo list all the containers that are running on your computer, run the command that appears in the following listing. The output of the command has been edited to fit on the page—the last two lines of the output are the continuation of the first two.\nListing 2.6 Listing running containers\n$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID    IMAGE           COMMAND          CREATED        ...\n44d76963e8e1    kubia:latest    \"node app.js\"    6 minutes ago  ...\n\n...  STATUS          PORTS                     NAMES\n...  Up 6 minutes    0.0.0.0:1234->8080/tcp    kubia-container\n\nFor each container, Docker prints its ID and name, the image it uses, and the command it executes. It also shows when the container was created, what status it has, and which host ports are mapped to the container.\nGetting additional information about a container\nThe docker ps command shows the most basic information about the containers. To see additional information, you can use docker inspect:\n$ docker inspect kubia-container\n\nDocker prints a long JSON-formatted document containing a lot of information about the container, such as its state, config, and network settings, including its IP address.\nInspecting the application log\nDocker captures and stores everything the application writes to the standard output and error streams. This is typically the place where applications write their logs. You can use the docker logs command to see the output, as shown in the next listing.\nListing 2.7 Displaying the container’s log\n$ docker logs kubia-container\nKubia server starting...\nLocal hostname is 44d76963e8e1\nListening on port 8080\nReceived request for / from ::ffff:172.17.0.1\n\nYou now know the basic commands for executing and inspecting an application in a container. Next, you’ll learn how to distribute it.\nDistributing container images\nThe image you’ve built is currently only available locally. To run it on other computers, you must first push it to an external image registry. Let’s push it to the public Docker Hub registry, so that you don’t need to set up a private one. You can also use other registries, such as Quay.io, which I’ve already mentioned, or the Google Container Registry.\nBefore you push the image, you must re-tag it according to Docker Hub’s image naming schema. The image name must include your Docker Hub ID, which you choose when you register at http://hub.docker.com. I’ll use my own ID (luksa) in the following examples, so remember to replace it with your ID when trying the commands yourself.\nTagging an image under an additional tag\nOnce you have your ID, you’re ready to add an additional tag for your image. Its current name is kubia and you’ll now tag it also as yourid/kubia:1.0 (replace yourid with your actual Docker Hub ID). This is the command I used:\n$ docker tag kubia luksa/kubia:1.0\n\nConfirm that your image now has two names by listing images again, as in the following listing.\nListing 2.7 A container image with multiple tags\n$ docker images | head\nREPOSITORY     TAG       IMAGE ID        CREATED              VIRTUAL SIZE\nluksa/kubia    1.0       b0ecc49d7a1d    About an hour ago    908 MB\nkubia          latest    b0ecc49d7a1d    About an hour ago    908 MB\nnode           12        e498dabfee1c    3 days ago           908 MB\n\nAs you can see, both kubia and luksa/kubia:1.0 point to the same image ID, meaning that these aren’t two images, but a single image with two names.\nPushing the image to Docker Hub\nBefore you can push the image to Docker Hub, you must log in with your user ID using the docker login command as follows:\n$ docker login -u yourid -p yourpassword docker.io\n\nOnce logged in, push the yourid/kubia:1.0 image to Docker Hub with the following command:\n$ docker push yourid/kubia:1.0\n\nRunning the image on other hosts\nWhen the push to Docker Hub is complete, the image is available to all. You can now run the image on any Docker-enabled host by running the following command:\n$ docker run -p 1234:8080 -d luksa/kubia:1.0\n\nIf the container runs correctly on your computer, it should run on any other Linux computer, provided that the Node.js binary doesn’t need any special Kernel features (it doesn’t).\nStopping and deleting containers\nIf you’ve run the container on the other host, you can now terminate it, as you’ll only need the one on your local computer for the exercises that follow.\nStopping a container\nInstruct Docker to stop the container with this command:\n$ docker stop kubia-container\n\nThis sends a termination signal to the main process in the container so that it can shut down gracefully. If the process doesn’t respond to the termination signal or doesn’t shut down in time, Docker kills it. When the top-level process in the container terminates, no other process runs in the container, so the container is stopped.\nDeleting a container\nThe container is no longer running, but it still exists. Docker keeps it around in case you decide to start it again. You can see stopped containers by running docker ps -a. The -a option prints all the containers - those running and those that have been stopped. As an exercise, you can start the container again by running docker start kubia-container.\nYou can safely delete the container on the other host, because you no longer need it. To delete it, run the following docker rm command:\n$ docker rm kubia-container\n\nThis deletes the container. All its contents are removed and it can no longer be started. The image is still there, though. If you decide to create the container again, the image won’t need to be downloaded again. If you also want to delete the image, use the docker rmi command:\n$ docker rmi kubia:latest\n\nTo remove all dangling images, you can also use the docker image prune command.\n"},"docs/Understanding_what_makes_containers_possible.html":{"url":"docs/Understanding_what_makes_containers_possible.html","title":"2.3 Understanding what makes containers possible","keywords":"","body":"2.3 Understanding what makes containers possible\nYou should keep the container running on your local computer so that you can use it in the following exercises, in which you’ll examine how containers allow process isolation without using virtual machines. Several features of the Linux kernel make this possible and it’s time to get to know them.\nUsing Namespaces to customize the environment of a process\nThe first feature called Linux Namespaces ensures that each process has its own view of the system. This means that a process running in a container will only see some of the files, processes and network interfaces on the system, as well as a different system hostname, just as if it were running in a separate virtual machine.\nInitially, all the system resources available in a Linux OS, such as filesystems, process IDs, user IDs, network interfaces, and others, are all in the same bucket that all processes see and use. But the Kernel allows you to create additional buckets known as namespaces and move resources into them so that they are organized in smaller sets. This allows you to make each set visible only to one process or a group of processes. When you create a new process, you can specify which namespace it should use. The process only sees resources that are in this namespace and none in the other namespaces.\nIntroducing the available namespace types\nMore specifically, there isn’t just a single type of namespace. There are in fact several types – one for each resource type. A process thus uses not only one namespace, but one namespace for each type.\nThe following types of namespaces exist:\n\nThe Mount namespace (mnt) isolates mount points (file systems).\nThe Process ID namespace (pid) isolates process IDs.\nThe Network namespace (net) isolates network devices, stacks, ports, etc.\nThe Inter-process communication namespace (ipc) isolates the communication between processes (this includes isolating message queues, shared memory, and others).\nThe UNIX Time-sharing System (UTS) namespace isolates the system hostname and the Network Information Service (NIS) domain name.\nThe User ID namespace (user) isolates user and group IDs.\nThe Cgroup namespace isolates the Control Groups root directory. You’ll learn about cgroups later in this chapter.\n\nUsing network namespaces to give a process a dedicated set of network interfaces\nThe network namespace in which a process runs determines what network interfaces the process can see. Each network interface belongs to exactly one namespace but can be moved from one namespace to another. If each container uses its own network namespace, each container sees its own set of network interfaces.\nExamine figure 2.13 for a better overview of how network namespaces are used to create a container. Imagine you want to run a containerized process and provide it with a dedicated set of network interfaces that only that process can use.\nFigure 2.13 The network namespace limits which network interfaces a process uses\n\nInitially, only the default network namespace exists. You then create two new network interfaces for the container and a new network namespace. The interfaces can then be moved from the default namespace to the new namespace. Once there, they can be renamed, because names must only be unique in each namespace. Finally, the process can be started in this network namespace, which allows it to only see the two interfaces that were created for it.\nBy looking solely at the available network interfaces, the process can’t tell whether it’s in a container or a VM or an OS running directly on a bare-metal machine.\nUsing the UTS namespace to give a process a dedicated hostname\nAnother example of how to make it look like the process is running on its own host is to use the UTS namespace. It determines what hostname and domain name the process running inside this namespace sees. By assigning two different UTS namespaces to two different processes, you can make them see different system hostnames. To the two processes, it looks as if they run on two different computers.\nUnderstanding how namespaces isolate processes from each other\nBy creating a dedicated namespace instance for all available namespace types and assigning it to a process, you can make the process believe that it’s running in its own OS. The main reason for this is that each process has its own environment. A process can only see and use the resources in its own namespaces. It can’t use any in other namespaces. Likewise, other processes can’t use its resources either. This is how containers isolate the environments of the processes that run within them.\nSharing namespaces between multiple processes\nIn the next chapter you’ll learn that you don’t always want to isolate the containers completely from each other. Related containers may want to share certain resources. The following figure shows an example of two processes that share the same network interfaces and the host and domain name of the system, but not the file system.\nFigure 2.14 Each process is associated with multiple namespace types, some of which can be shared.\n\nConcentrate on the shared network devices first. The two processes see and use the same two devices (eth0 and lo) because they use the same network namespace. This allows them to bind to the same IP address and communicate through the loopback device, just as they could if they were running on a machine that doesn’t use containers. The two processes also use the same UTS namespace and therefore see the same system host name. In contrast, they each use their own mount namespace, which means they have separate file systems.\nIn summary, processes may want to share some resources but not others. This is possible because separate namespace types exist. A process has an associated namespace for each type.\nIn view of all this, one might ask what is a container at all? A process that runs “in a container” doesn’t run in something that resembles a real enclosure like a VM. It’s only a process to which seven namespaces (one for each type) are assigned. Some are shared with other processes, while others are not. This means that the boundaries between the processes do not all fall on the same line.\nIn a later chapter, you’ll learn how to debug a container by running a new process directly on the host OS, but using the network namespace of an existing container, while using the host’s default namespaces for everything else. This will allow you to debug the container’s networking system with tools available on the host that may not be available in the container.\nExploring the environment of a running container\nWhat if you want to see what the environment inside the container looks like? What is the system host name, what is the local IP address, what binaries and libraries are available on the file system, and so on?\nTo explore these features in the case of a VM, you typically connect to it remotely via ssh and use a shell to execute commands. This process is very similar for containers. You run a shell inside the container.\nNOTE\nThe shell’s executable file must be available in the container’s file system. This isn’t always the case with containers running in production.\n\nRunning a shell inside an existing container\nThe Node.js image on which your image is based provides the bash shell, meaning you can run it in the container with the following command:\n$ docker exec -it kubia-container bash\nroot@44d76963e8e1:/#\n\nThis command runs bash as an additional process in the existing kubia-container container. The process has the same Linux namespaces as the main container process (the running Node.js server). This way you can explore the container from within and see how Node.js and your app see the system when running in the container. The -it option is shorthand for two options:\n\n-i tells Docker to run the command in interactive mode.\n-t tells it to allocate a pseudo terminal (TTY) so you can use the shell properly.\n\nYou need both if you want to use the shell the way you’re used to. If you omit the first, you can’t execute any commands, and if you omit the second, the command prompt doesn’t appear and some commands may complain that the TERM variable is not set.\nListing running processes in a container\nLet’s list the processes running in the container by executing the ps aux command inside the shell you ran in the container. The following listing shows the command’s output.\nListing 2.8 Listing processes running in the container\nroot@44d76963e8e1:/# ps aux\nUSER  PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND\nroot    1  0.0  0.1 676380 16504 ?   Sl   12:31 0:00 node app.js\nroot   10  0.0  0.0  20216  1924 ?   Ss   12:31 0:00 bash\nroot   19  0.0  0.0  17492  1136 ?   R+   12:38 0:00 ps aux\nThe list shows only three processes. These are the only ones that run in the container. You can’t see the other processes that run in the host OS or in other containers because the container runs in its own Process ID namespace.\nSeeing container processes in the host’s list of processes\nIf you now open another terminal and list the processes in the host OS itself, you will also see the processes that run in the container. This confirms that the processes in the container are in fact regular processes that run in the host OS, as you can see in the following listing.\nListing 2.9 A container’s processes run in the host OS\n$ ps aux | grep app.js\nUSER  PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND\nroot  382  0.0  0.1 676380 16504 ?   Sl   12:31 0:00 node app.js\n\nNOTE\nIf you use macOS or Windows, you must list the processes in the VM that hosts the Docker daemon, as that’s where your containers run. In Docker Desktop, you can enter the VM using the following command: docker run --net=host --ipc=host --uts=host --pid=host -it --security-opt=seccomp=unconfined --privileged --rm -v /:/host alpine chroot /host\n\nIf you have a sharp eye, you may notice that the process IDs in the container are different from those on the host. Because the container uses its own Process ID namespace it has its own process tree with its own ID number sequence. As the next figure shows, the tree is a subtree of the host’s full process tree. Each process thus has two IDs.\nFigure 2.15 The PID namespace makes a process sub-tree appear as a separate process tree with its own numbering sequence\n\nthe container’s filesystem is isolated from the host and other containers\nAs with an isolated process tree, each container also has an isolated filesystem. If you list the contents of the container’s root directory, only the files in the container are displayed. This includes files from the container image and files created during container operation, such as log files. The next listing shows the files in your kubia container.\nListing 2.10 A container has its own filesystem\nroot@44d76963e8e1:/# ls /\napp.js  boot  etc   lib    media  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr\nbin     dev   home  lib64  mnt    proc  run   srv   tmp  var\n\nIt contains the app.js file and other system directories that are part of the node:12 base image. You are welcome to browse the container’s filesystem. You’ll see that there is no way to view files from the host’s filesystem. This is great, because it prevents a potential attacker from gaining access to them through vulnerabilities in the Node.js server.\nTo leave the container, leave the shell by running the exit command or pressing Control-D and you’ll be returned to your host computer (similar to logging out from an ssh session).\nTIP\nEntering a running container like this is useful when debugging an app running in a container. When something breaks, the first thing you’ll want to investigate is the actual state of the system your application sees.\n\nLimiting a process’ resource usage with Linux Control Groups\nLinux Namespaces make it possible for processes to access only some of the host’s resources, but they don’t limit how much of a single resource each process can consume. For example, you can use namespaces to allow a process to access only a particular network interface, but you can’t limit the network bandwidth the process consumes. Likewise, you can’t use namespaces to limit the CPU time or memory available to a process. You may want to do that to prevent one process from consuming all the CPU time and preventing critical system processes from running properly. For that, we need another feature of the Linux kernel.\nIntroducing cgroups\nThe second Linux kernel feature that makes containers possible is called Linux Control Groups (cgroups). It limits, accounts for and isolates system resources such as CPU, memory and disk or network bandwidth. When using cgroups, a process or group of processes can only use the allotted CPU time, memory, and network bandwidth for example. This way, processes cannot occupy resources that are reserved for other processes.\nAt this point, you don’t need to know how Control Groups do all this, but it may be worth seeing how you can ask Docker to limit the amount of CPU and memory a container can use.\nLimiting a container’s use of the CPU\nIf you don’t impose any restrictions on the container’s use of the CPU, it has unrestricted access to all CPU cores on the host. You can explicitly specify which cores a container can use with Docker’s --cpuset-cpus option. For example, to allow the container to only use cores one and two, you can run the container with the following option:\n$ docker run --cpuset-cpus=\"1,2\" ...\n\nYou can also limit the available CPU time using options --cpus, --cpu-period, --cpu-quota and --cpu-shares. For example, to allow the container to use only half of a CPU core, run the container as follows:\n$ docker run --cpus=\"0.5\" ...\n\nLimiting a container’s use of memory\nAs with CPU, a container can use all the available system memory, just like any regular OS process, but you may want to limit this. Docker provides the following options to limit container memory and swap usage: --memory, --memory-reservation, --kernel-memory, --memory-swap, and --memory-swappiness.\nFor example, to set the maximum memory size available in the container to 100MB, run the container as follows (m stands for megabyte):\n$ docker run --memory=\"100m\" ...\n\nBehind the scenes, all these Docker options merely configure the cgroups of the process. It’s the Kernel that takes care of limiting the resources available to the process. See the Docker documentation for more information about the other memory and CPU limit options.\nStrengthening isolation between containers\nLinux Namespaces and Cgroups separate the containers’ environments and prevent one container from starving the other containers of compute resources. But the processes in these containers use the same system kernel, so we can’t say that they are really isolated. A rogue container could make malicious system calls that would affect its neighbours. \nImagine a Kubernetes node on which several containers run. Each has its own network devices and files and can only consume a limited amount of CPU and memory. At first glance, a rogue program in one of these containers can’t cause damage to the other containers. But what if the rogue program modifies the system clock that is shared by all containers?\nDepending on the application, changing the time may not be too much of a problem, but allowing programs to make any system call to the kernel allows them to do virtually anything. Sys-calls allow them to modify the kernel memory, add or remove kernel modules, and many other things that regular containers aren’t supposed to do.\nThis brings us to the third set of technologies that make containers possible. Explaining them fully is outside the scope of this book, so please refer to other resources that focus specifically on containers or the technologies used to secure them. This section provides a brief introduction to these technologies.\nGiving containers full privileges to the system\nThe operating system kernel provides a set of sys-calls that programs use to interact with the operating system and underlying hardware. These includes calls to create processes, manipulate files and devices, establish communication channels between applications, and so on.\nSome of these sys-calls are fairly safe and available to any process, but others are reserved for processes with elevated privileges only. If you look at the example presented earlier, applications running on the Kubernetes node should be allowed to open their local files, but not change the system clock or modify the kernel in a way that breaks the other containers.\nMost containers should run without elevated privileges. Only those programs that you trust and that actually need the additional privileges should run in privileged containers.\nNOTE\nWith Docker you create a privileged container by using the --privileged flag.\n\nUsing Capabilities to give containers a subset of all privileges\nIf an application only needs to invoke some of the sys-calls that require elevated privileges, creating a container with full privileges is not ideal. Fortunately, the Linux kernel also divides privileges into units called capabilities. Examples of capabilities are:\n\nCAP_NET_ADMIN allows the process to perform network-related operations,\nCAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE allows it to bind to port numbers less than 1024,\nCAP_SYS_TIME allows it to modify the system clock, and so on.\n\nCapabilities can be added or removed (dropped) from a container when you create it. Each capability represents a set of privileges available to the processes in the container. Docker and Kubernetes drop all capabilities except those required by typical applications, but users can add or drop other capabilities if authorized to do so.\nNOTE\nAlways follow the principle of least privilege when running containers. Don’t give them any capabilities that they don’t need. This prevents attackers from using them to gain access to your operating system.\n\nUsing seccomp profiles to filter individual sys-calls\nIf you need even finer control over what sys-calls a program can make, you can use seccomp (Secure Computing Mode). You can create a custom seccomp profile by creating a JSON file that lists the sys-calls that the container using the profile is allowed to make. You then provide the file to Docker when you create the container.\nHardening containers using AppArmor and SELinux\nAnd as if the technologies discussed so far weren’t enough, containers can also be secured with two additional mandatory access control (MAC) mechanisms: SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) and AppArmor (Application Armor).\nWith SELinux, you attach labels to files and system resources, as well as to users and processes. A user or process can only access a file or resource if the labels of all subjects and objects involved match a set of policies. AppArmor is similar but uses file paths instead of labels and focuses on processes rather than users.\nBoth SELinux and AppArmor considerably improve the security of an operating system, but don’t worry if you are overwhelmed by all these security-related mechanisms. The aim of this section was to shed light on everything involved in the proper isolation of containers, but a basic understanding of namespaces should be more than sufficient for the moment.\n"},"docs/Summary_2.html":{"url":"docs/Summary_2.html","title":"2.4 Summary","keywords":"","body":"2.4 Summary\nIf you were new to containers before reading this chapter, you should now understand what they are, why we use them, and what features of the Linux kernel make them possible. If you have previously used containers, I hope this chapter has helped to clarify your uncertainties about how containers work, and you now understand that they’re nothing more than regular OS processes that the Linux kernel isolates from other processes.\nAfter reading this chapter, you should know that:\n\nContainers are regular processes, but isolated from each other and the other processes running in the host OS.\nContainers are much lighter than virtual machines, but because they use the same Linux kernel, they aren’t as isolated as VMs.\nDocker was the first container platform to make containers popular and the first container runtime supported by Kubernetes. Now, others are supported through the Container Runtime Interface (CRI).\nA container image contains the user application and all its dependencies. It is distributed through a container registry and used to create running containers.\nContainers can be downloaded and executed with a single docker run command.\nDocker builds an image from a Dockerfile that contains commands that Docker should execute during the build process. Images consist of layers that can be shared between multiple images. Each layer only needs to be transmitted and stored once.\nContainers are isolated by Linux kernel features called Namespaces, Control groups, Capabilities, seccomp, AppArmor and/or SELinux. Namespaces ensure that a container sees only a part of the resources available on the host, Control groups limit the amount of a resource it can use, while other features strengthen the isolation between containers.\n\nAfter inspecting the containers on this ship, you’re now ready to raise the anchor and sail into the next chapter, where you’ll learn about running containers with Kubernetes.\n"},"docs/Deploying_your_first_application.html":{"url":"docs/Deploying_your_first_application.html","title":"3 DEPLOYING YOUR FIRST APPLICATION","keywords":"","body":"3.

A proper Kubernetes installation spans multiple physical or virtual machines and requires proper network setup to allow all containers in the cluster to communicate with each other.\nYou can install Kubernetes on your laptop computer, on your organization’s infrastructure, or on virtual machines provided by cloud providers (Google Compute Engine, Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, and so on). Alternatively, most cloud providers now offer managed Kubernetes services, saving you from the hassle of installation and management. Here’s a short overview of what the largest cloud providers offer:\n\nGoogle offers GKE - Google Kubernetes Engine,\nAmazon has EKS - Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service,\nMicrosoft has AKS – Azure Kubernetes Service,\nIBM has IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service,\nAlibaba provides the Alibaba Cloud Container Service.\n\nInstalling and managing Kubernetes is much more difficult than just using it, especially until you’re intimately familiar with its architecture and operation. For this reason, we’ll start with the easiest ways to obtain a working Kubernetes cluster. You’ll learn several ways to run a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local computer and how to use a hosted cluster running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).\nA third option, which involves installing a cluster using the kubeadm tool, is explained in Appendix B. The tutorial there will show you how to set up a three-node Kubernetes cluster using virtual machines. But you may want to try that only after you’ve become familiar with using Kubernetes. Many other options also exist, but they are beyond the scope of this book. Refer to the kubernetes.io website to learn more.\nIf you’ve been granted access to an existing cluster deployed by someone else, you can skip this section and go on to section 3.2 where you’ll learn how to interact with Kubernetes clusters.\nUsing the built-in Kubernetes cluster in Docker Desktop\nIf you use macOS or Windows, you’ve most likely installed Docker Desktop to run the exercises in the previous chapter. It contains a single-node Kubernetes cluster that you can enable via its Settings dialog box. This may be the easiest way for you to start your Kubernetes journey, but keep in mind that the version of Kubernetes may not be as recent as when using the alternative options described in the next sections.\nNOTE\nAlthough technically not a cluster, the single-node Kubernetes system provided by Docker Desktop should be enough to explore most of the topics discussed in this book. When an exercise requires a multi-node cluster, I will point this out.\n\nEnabling Kubernetes in Docker Desktop\nAssuming Docker Desktop is already installed on your computer, you can start the Kubernetes cluster by clicking the whale icon in the system tray and opening the Settings dialog box. Click the Kubernetes tab and make sure the Enable Kubernetes checkbox is selected. The components that make up the Control Plane run as Docker containers, but they aren’t displayed in the list of running containers when you invoke the docker ps command. To display them, select the Show system containers checkbox.\nNOTE\nThe initial installation of the cluster takes several minutes, as all container images for the Kubernetes components must be downloaded.\n\nFigure 3.1 The Settings dialog box in Docker Desktop for Windows\n\nRemember the Reset Kubernetes Cluster button if you ever want to reset the cluster to remove all the objects you’ve deployed in it.\nVisualizing the system\nTo understand where the various components that make up the Kubernetes cluster run in Docker Desktop, look at the following figure.\nFigure 3.2 Kubernetes running in Docker Desktop\n\nDocker Desktop sets up a Linux virtual machine that hosts the Docker Daemon and all the containers. This VM also runs the Kubelet - the Kubernetes agent that manages the node. The components of the Control Plane run in containers, as do all the applications you deploy.\nTo list the running containers, you don’t need to log on to the VM because the docker CLI tool available in your host OS displays them.\nExploring the Virtual Machine from the inside\nAt the time of writing, Docker Desktop provides no command to log into the VM if you want to explore it from the inside. However, you can run a special container configured to use the VM’s namespaces to run a remote shell, which is virtually identical to using SSH to access a remote server. To run the container, execute the following command:\n$ docker run --net=host --ipc=host --uts=host --pid=host --privileged \\\n  --security-opt=seccomp=unconfined -it --rm -v /:/host alpine chroot /host\nThis long command requires explanation:\n\nThe container is created from the alpine image.\nThe --net, --ipc, --uts and --pid flags make the container use the host’s namespaces instead of being sandboxed, and the --privileged and --security-opt flags give the container unrestricted access to all sys-calls.\nThe -it flag runs the container interactive mode and the --rm flags ensures the container is deleted when it terminates.\nThe -v flag mounts the host’s root directory to the /host directory in the container. The chroot /host command then makes this directory the root directory in the container.\n\nAfter you run the command, you are in a shell that’s effectively the same as if you had used SSH to enter the VM. Use this shell to explore the VM - try listing processes by executing the ps aux command or explore the network interfaces by running ip addr.\nRunning a local cluster using Minikube\nAnother way to create a Kubernetes cluster is to use Minikube, a tool maintained by the Kubernetes community. The version of Kubernetes that Minikube deploys is usually more recent than the version deployed by Docker Desktop. The cluster consists of a single node and is suitable for both testing Kubernetes and developing applications locally. It normally runs Kubernetes in a Linux VM, but if your computer is Linux-based, it can also deploy Kubernetes directly in your host OS via Docker.\nNOTE\nIf you configure Minikube to use a VM, you don’t need Docker, but you do need a hypervisor like VirtualBox. In the other case you need Docker, but not the hypervisor.\n\nInstalling Minikube\nMinikube supports macOS, Linux, and Windows. It has a single binary executable file, which you’ll find in the Minikube repository on GitHub (http://github.com/kubernetes/minikube). It’s best to follow the current installation instructions published there, but roughly speaking, you install it as follows.\nOn macOS you can install it using the Brew Package Manager, on Windows there’s an installer that you can download, and on Linux you can either download  a .deb or .rpm package or simply download the binary file and make it executable with the following command:\n$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube\n[CA] -linux-amd64 && sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/mini\n[CA] kube\nFor details on your specific OS, please refer to the installation guide online.\nStarting a Kubernetes cluster with Minikube\nAfter Minikube is installed, start the Kubernetes cluster as indicated in the following listing.\nListing 3.1 Starting Kubernetes with Minikube\n$ minikube start\nminikube v1.11.0 on Fedora 31\nUsing the virtualbox driver based on user configuration\nDownloading VM boot image ...\n> minikube-v1.11.0.iso.sha256: 65 B / 65 B [-------------] 100.00% ? p/s 0s\n> minikube-v1.11.0.iso: 174.99 MiB / 174.99 MiB [] 100.00% 50.16 MiB p/s 4s\nStarting control plane node minikube in cluster minikube\nDownloading Kubernetes v1.18.3 preload ...\n> preloaded-images-k8s-v3-v1.18.3-docker-overlay2-amd64.tar.lz4: 526.01 MiB\nCreating virtualbox VM (CPUs=2, Memory=6000MB, Disk=20000MB) ...\nPreparing Kubernetes v1.18.3 on Docker 19.03.8 ...\nVerifying Kubernetes components...\nEnabled addons: default-storageclass, storage-provisioner\nDone! kubectl is now configured to use \"minikube\"\nThe process may take several minutes, because the VM image and the container images of the Kubernetes components must be downloaded.\nTIP\nIf you use Linux, you can reduce the resources required by Minikube by creating the cluster without a VM. Use this command: \nminikube start --vm-driver none\n\nChecking Minikube’s status\nWhen the minikube start command is complete, you can check the status of the cluster by running minikube status, as shown in the following listing.\nListing 3.2 Checking Minikube’s status\n$ minikube status\nhost: Running\nkubelet: Running\napiserver: Running\nkubeconfig: Configured\nThe output of the command shows that the Kubernetes host (the VM that hosts Kubernetes) is running, and so are the Kubelet – the agent responsible for managing the node – and the Kubernetes API server. The last line shows that the kubectl command-line tool (CLI) is configured to use the Kubernetes cluster that Minikube has provided. Minikube doesn’t install the CLI tool, but it does create its configuration file. Installation of the CLI tool is explained in section 3.2.\nVisualizing the system\nThe architecture of the system, which is shown in the next figure, is practically identical to the one in Docker Desktop.\nFigure 3.3 Running a single-node Kubernetes cluster using Minikube\n\nThe Control Plane components run in containers in the VM or directly in your host OS if you used the --vm-driver none option to create the cluster. The Kubelet runs directly in the VM’s or your host’s operating system. It runs the applications you deploy in the cluster via the Docker Daemon.\nYou can run minikube ssh to log into the Minikube VM and explore it from inside. For example, you can see what’s running in the VM by running ps aux to list running processes or docker ps to list running containers.\nTIP\nIf you want to list containers using your local docker CLI instance, as in the case of Docker Desktop, run the following command: eval $(minikube docker-env)\n\nRunning a local cluster using kind (Kubernetes in Docker)\nAn alternative to Minikube, although not as mature, is kind (Kubernetes-in-Docker). Instead of running Kubernetes in a virtual machine or directly on the host, kind runs each Kubernetes cluster node inside a container. Unlike Minikube, this allows it to create multi-node clusters by starting several containers. The actual application containers that you deploy to Kubernetes then run within these node containers. The system is shown in the next figure.\nFigure 3.4 Running a multi-node Kubernetes cluster using kind\n\nIn the previous chapter I mentioned that a process that runs in a container actually runs in the host OS. This means that when you run Kubernetes using kind, all Kubernetes components run in your host OS. The applications you deploy to the Kubernetes cluster also run in your host OS.\nThis makes kind the perfect tool for development and testing, as everything runs locally and you can debug running processes as easily as when you run them outside of a container. I prefer to use this approach when I develop apps on Kubernetes, as it allows me to do magical things like run network traffic analysis tools such as Wireshark or even my web browser inside the containers that run my applications. I use a tool called nsenter that allows me to run these tools in the network or other namespaces of the container.\nIf you’re new to Kubernetes, the safest bet is to start with Minikube, but if you’re feeling adventurous, here’s how to get started with kind.\nInstalling kind\nJust like Minikube, kind consists of a single binary executable file. To install it, refer to the installation instructions at https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/. On macOS and Linux, the command to install it is as follows:\n$ curl -Lo ./kind https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases/\n[CA] download/v0.7.0/kind-$(uname)-amd64 && \\\n[CA] chmod +x ./kind && \\\n[CA] mv ./kind /some-dir-in-your-PATH/kind\nCheck the documentation to see what the latest version is and use it instead of v0.7.0 in the above example. Also, replace /some-dir-in-your-PATH/ with an actual directory in your path.\nNOTE\n Docker must be installed on your system to use kind.\n\nStarting a Kubernetes cluster with kind\nStarting a new cluster is as easy as it is with Minikube. Execute the following command:\n$ kind create cluster\nLike Minikube, kind configures kubectl to use the cluster that it creates.\nStarting a multi-node cluster with kind\nKind runs a single-node cluster by default. If you want to run a cluster with multiple worker nodes, you must first create a configuration file named kind-multi-node.yaml with the following content (you can find the file in the book’s code archive, directory Chapter03/):\nListing 3.3 Config file for running a three-node cluster with kind\nkind: Cluster\napiVersion: kind.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha3\nnodes:\n- role: control-plane\n- role: worker\n- role: worker\nWith the file in place, create the cluster using the following command:\n$ kind create cluster --config kind-multi-node.yaml\nListing worker nodes\nAt the time of this writing, kind doesn’t provide a command to check the status of the cluster, but you can list cluster nodes using kind get nodes, as shown in the next listing.\nListing 3.4 Listing nodes using kind get nodes\n$ kind get nodes\nkind-worker2\nkind-worker\nkind-control-plane\nNOTE\nDue to width restrictions, the node names control-plane, worker1, and worker2 are used instead of the actual node names throughout this book.\n\nSince each node runs as a container, you can also see the nodes by listing the running containers using docker ps, as the next listing shows.\nListing 3.5 Displaying kind nodes running as containers\n$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID    IMAGE                   ...    NAMES\n45d0f712eac0    kindest/node:v1.18.2    ...    kind-worker2\nd1e88e98e3ae    kindest/node:v1.18.2    ...    kind-worker\n4b7751144ca4    kindest/node:v1.18.2    ...    kind-control-plane\nLogging into cluster nodes provisioned by kind\nUnlike Minikube, where you use minikube ssh to log into the node if you want to explore the processes running inside it, with kind you use docker exec. For example, to enter the node called kind-control-plane, run:\n$ docker exec -it kind-control-plane bash\n\nInstead of using Docker to run containers, nodes created by kind use the CRI-O container runtime, which I mentioned in the previous chapter as a lightweight alternative to Docker. The crictl CLI tool is used to interact with CRI-O. Its use is very similar to that of the docker tool. After logging into the node, list the containers running in it by running crictl ps instead of docker ps. An example of the command’s output is shown in the next listing:\nListing 3.6 Listing containers inside a cluster node provisioned with kind\nroot@kind-control-plane:/# crictl ps\nCONTAINER ID    IMAGE           CREATED      STATE     NAME\nc7f44d171fb72   eb516548c180f   15 min ago   Running   coredns        ...\ncce9c0261854c   eb516548c180f   15 min ago   Running   coredns        ...\ne6522aae66fcc   d428039608992   16 min ago   Running   kube-proxy     ...\n6b2dc4bbfee0c   ef97cccdfdb50   16 min ago   Running   kindnet-cni    ...\nc3e66dfe44deb   be321f2ded3f3   16 min ago   Running   kube-apiserver ...\nCreating a managed cluster with Google Kubernetes Engine\nIf you want to use a full-fledged multi-node Kubernetes cluster instead of a local one, you can use a managed cluster, such as the one provided by Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This way, you don’t have to manually set up all the cluster nodes and networking, which is usually too hard for someone taking their first steps with Kubernetes. Using a managed solution such as GKE ensures that you don’t end up with an incorrectly configured cluster.\nSetting up Google Cloud and installing the gcloud client binary\nBefore you can set up a new Kubernetes cluster, you must set up your GKE environment. The process may change in the future, so I’ll only give you a few general instructions here. For complete instructions, refer to https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/before-you-begin.\nRoughly, the whole procedure includes\n\nSigning up for a Google account if you don’t have one already.\nCreating a project in the Google Cloud Platform Console.\nEnabling billing. This does require your credit card info, but Google provides a 12-month free trial with a free $300 credit. And they don’t start charging automatically after the free trial is over.\nDownloading and installing the Google Cloud SDK, which includes the gcloud tool.\nCreating the cluster using the gcloud command-line tool.\n\nNOTE\nCertain operations (the one in step 2, for example) may take a few minutes to complete, so relax and grab a coffee in the meantime.\n\nCreating a GKE Kubernetes cluster with three nodes\nBefore you create your cluster, you must decide in which geographical region and zone it should be created. Refer to https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones to see the list of available locations. In the following examples, I use the europe-west3 region based in Frankfurt, Germany. It has three different zones - I’ll use the zone europe-west3-c. The default zone for all gcloud operations can be set with the following command:\n$ gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west3-c\nCreate the Kubernetes cluster using the command shown in the next listing. You can choose a name other than kubia if you wish.\nListing 3.7 Creating a three-node cluster in GKE\n$ gcloud container clusters create kubia --num-nodes 3\nCreating cluster kubia in europe-west3-c...\n...\nkubeconfig entry generated for kubia.\nNAME   LOCAT.   MASTER_VER  MASTER_IP   MACH_TYPE     ... NODES STATUS\nkubia  eu-w3-c  1.13.11...  5.24.21.22  n1-standard-1 ... 3     RUNNING\nNOTE\nI’m creating all three worker nodes in the same zone, but you can also spread them across all zones in the region by setting the compute/zone config value to an entire region instead of a single zone. If you do so, note that --num-nodes indicates the number of nodes per zone. If the region contains three zones and you only want three nodes, you must set --num-nodes to 1.\n\nYou should now have a running Kubernetes cluster with three worker nodes. Each node is a virtual machine provided by the Google Compute Engine (GCE) infrastructure-as-a-service platform. You can list GCE virtual machines using the command in the next listing.\nListing 3.8 Listing GCE virtual machines\n$ gcloud compute instances list\nNAME      ZONE        MACHINE_TYPE   INTERNAL_IP  EXTERNAL_IP     STATUS\n...-ctlk  eu-west3-c  n1-standard-1  10.156.0.16  34.89.238.55    RUNNING\n...-gj1f  eu-west3-c  n1-standard-1  10.156.0.14  35.242.223.97   RUNNING\n...-r01z  eu-west3-c  n1-standard-1  10.156.0.15  35.198.191.189  RUNNING\nTIP\nEach VM incurs costs. To reduce the cost of your cluster, you can reduce the number of nodes to one, or even to zero while not using it. See next section for details.\n\nThe system is shown in the next figure. Note that only your worker nodes run in GCE virtual machines. The control plane runs elsewhere - you can’t access the machines hosting it.\nFigure 3.5 Your Kubernetes cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine\n\nScaling the number of nodes\nGoogle allows you to easily increase or decrease the number of nodes in your cluster. For most exercises in this book you can scale it down to just one node if you want to save money. You can even scale it down to zero so that your cluster doesn’t incur any costs.\nTo scale the cluster to zero, use the following command:\n$ gcloud container clusters resize kubia --size 0\nThe nice thing about scaling to zero is that none of the objects you create in your Kubernetes cluster, including the applications you deploy, are deleted. Granted, if you scale down to zero, the applications will have no nodes to run on, so they won’t run. But as soon as you scale the cluster back up, they will be redeployed. And even with no worker nodes you can still interact with the Kubernetes API (you can create, update, and delete objects).\nInspecting a GKE worker node\nIf you’re interested in what’s running on your nodes, you can log into them with the following command (use one of the node names from the output of the previous command):\n$ gcloud compute ssh gke-kubia-default-pool-9bba9b18-4glf\nWhile logged into the node, you can try to list all running containers with docker ps. You haven’t run any applications yet, so you’ll only see Kubernetes system containers. What they are isn’t important right now, but you’ll learn about them in later chapters.\nCreating a cluster using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service\nIf you prefer to use Amazon instead of Google to deploy your Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, you can try the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Let’s go over the basics.\nFirst, you have to install the eksctl command-line tool by following the instructions at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html.\nCreating an EKS Kubernetes cluster\nCreating an EKS Kubernetes cluster using eksctl does not differ significantly from how you create a cluster in GKE. All you must do is run the following command:\n$ eksctl create cluster --name kubia --region eu-central-1\n[CA] --nodes 3 --ssh-access\nThis command creates a three-node cluster in the eu-central-1 region. The regions are listed at https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/.\nInspecting an EKS worker node\nIf you’re interested in what’s running on those nodes, you can use SSH to connect to them. The --ssh-access flag used in the command that creates the cluster ensures that your SSH public key is imported to the node.\nAs with GKE and Minikube, once you’ve logged into the node, you can try to list all running containers with docker ps. You can expect to see similar containers as in the clusters we covered earlier.\nDeploying a multi-node cluster from scratch\nUntil you get a deeper understanding of Kubernetes, I strongly recommend that you don’t try to install a multi-node cluster from scratch. If you are an experienced systems administrator, you may be able to do it without much pain and suffering, but most people may want to try one of the methods described in the previous sections first. Proper management of Kubernetes clusters is incredibly difficult. The installation alone is a task not to be underestimated.\nIf you still feel adventurous, you can start with the instructions in Appendix B, which explain how to create VMs with VirtualBox and install Kubernetes using the kubeadm tool. You can also use those instructions to install Kubernetes on your bare-metal machines or in VMs running in the cloud.\nOnce you’ve successfully deployed one or two clusters using kubeadm, you can then try to deploy it completely manually, by following Kelsey Hightower’s Kubernetes the Hard Way tutorial at github.com/kelseyhightower/Kubernetes-the-hard-way. Though you may run into several problems, figuring out how to solve them can be a great learning experience.\n"},"docs/Interacting_with_Kubernetes.html":{"url":"docs/Interacting_with_Kubernetes.html","title":"3.2 Interacting with Kubernetes","keywords":"","body":"3.2 Interacting with Kubernetes\nYou’ve now learned about several possible methods to deploy a Kubernetes cluster. Now’s the time to learn how to use the cluster. To interact with Kubernetes, you use a command-line tool called kubectl, pronounced kube-control, kube-C-T-L or kube-cuddle.\nAs the next figure shows, the tool communicates with the Kubernetes API server, which is part of the Kubernetes Control Plane. The control plane then triggers the other components to do whatever needs to be done based on the changes you made via the API.\nFigure 3.6 How you interact with a Kubernetes cluster\n\nSetting up kubectl - the Kubernetes command-line client\nKubectl is a single executable file that you must download to your computer and place into your path. It loads its configuration from a configuration file called kubeconfig. To use kubectl, you must both install it and prepare the kubeconfig file so kubectl knows what cluster to talk to.\nDownloading and Installing kubectl\nThe latest stable release for Linux can be downloaded and installed with the following command:\n$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release\n[CA] /$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release\n[CA] /stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl\n[CA] && chmod +x kubectl\n[CA] && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/\nTo install kubectl on macOS, you can either run the same command, but replace linux in the URL with darwin, or install the tool via Homebrew by running brew install kubectl.\nOn Windows, download kubectl.exe from https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.18.2/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe. To download the latest version, first go to https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt to see what the latest stable version is and then replace the version number in the first URL with this version. To check if you’ve installed it correctly, run kubectl --help. Note that kubectl may or may not yet be configured to talk to your Kubernetes cluster, which means most commands may not work yet.\nTIP\nYou can always append --help to any kubectl command to get information on what it does and how to use it.\n\nSetting up a short alias for kubectl\nYou’ll use kubectl often. Having to type the full command every time is needlessly time-consuming, but you can speed things up by setting up an alias and tab completion for it.\nMost users of Kubernetes use k as the alias for kubectl. If you haven’t used aliases yet, here’s how to define it in Linux and macOS. Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc or equivalent file:\nalias k=kubectl\nOn Windows, if you use the Command Prompt, define the alias by executing doskey k=kubectl $*. If you use PowerShell, execute set-alias -name k -value kubectl.\nNOTE \nYou may not need an alias if you used gcloud to set up the cluster. It installs the k binary in addition to kubectl.\n\nConfiguring tab completion for kubectl\nEven with a short alias like k, you’ll still have to type a lot. Fortunately, the kubectl command can also output shell completion code for both the bash and the zsh shell. It enables tab completion of not only command names but also the object names. For example, later you’ll learn how to view details of a particular cluster node by executing the following command:\n$ kubectl describe node gke-kubia-default-pool-9bba9b18-4glf\nThat’s a lot of typing that you’ll repeat all the time. With tab completion, things are much easier. You just press TAB after typing the first few characters of each token:\n$ kubectl desc no gke-ku\nTo enable tab completion in bash, you must first install a package called bash-completion and then run the following command (you can also add it to ~/.bashrc or equivalent):\n$ source \nBut there’s one caveat. This will only complete your commands when you use the full kubectl command name. It won’t work when you use the k alias. To enable completion for the alias, you must run the following command:\n$ complete -o default -F __start_kubectl k\nConfiguring kubectl to use a specific Kubernetes cluster\nThe kubeconfig configuration file is located at ~/.kube/config. If you deployed your cluster using Docker Desktop, Minikube or GKE, the file was created for you. If you’ve been given access to an existing cluster, you should have received the file. Other tools, such as kind, may have written the file to a different location. Instead of moving the file to the default location, you can also point kubectl to it by setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable as follows:\n$ export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/custom/kubeconfig\nTo learn more about how to manage kubectl’s configuration and create a config file from scratch, refer to appendix A.\nNOTE \nIf you want to use several Kubernetes clusters (for example, both Minikube and GKE), see appendix A for information on switching between different kubectl contexts.\n\nUsing kubectl\nAssuming you’ve installed and configured kubectl, you can now use it to talk to your cluster.\nVerifying if the cluster is up and kubectl can talk to it\nTo verify that your cluster is working, use the kubectl cluster-info command shown in the following listing.\nListing 3.9 Displaying cluster information\n$ kubectl cluster-info\nKubernetes master is running at https://192.168.99.101:8443\nKubeDNS is running at https://192.168.99.101:8443/api/v1/namespaces/...\nThis indicates that the API server is active and responding to requests. The output lists the URLs of the various Kubernetes cluster services running in your cluster. The above example shows that besides the API server, the KubeDNS service, which provides domain-name sevices within the cluster, is another service that runs in the cluster.\nListing cluster nodes\nNow use the kubectl command to list all nodes in your cluster. The following listing shows the output that is generated when executing kubectl against a GKE cluster with three nodes.\nListing 3.10 Listing cluster nodes with kubectl\n$ kubectl get nodes\nNAME            STATUS  ROLES   AGE   VERSION\ncontrol-plane   Ready     12m   v1.18.2\nworker1         Ready     12m   v1.18.2\nworker2         Ready     12m   v1.18.2\nEverything in Kubernetes is represented by an object and can be retrieved and manipulated via the RESTful API. The kubectl get command retrieves a list of objects of the specified type from the API. You’ll use this command all the time, but it only displays summary information about the listed objects.\nRetrieving additional details of an object\nTo see more detailed information about an object, you use the kubectl describe command, which shows much more:\n$ kubectl describe node gke-kubia-85f6-node-0rrx\nI omit the actual output of the describe command because it’s quite wide and would be completely unreadable here in the book. If you run the command yourself, you’ll see that it displays the status of the node, information about its CPU and memory usage, system information, containers running on the node, and much more.\nIf you run the kubectl describe command without specifying the resource name, information of all nodes will be printed.\nTIP \nExecuting the describe command without specifying the object name is useful when only one object of a certain type exists. You don’t have to type or copy/paste the object name.\n\nYou’ll learn more about the numerous other kubectl commands throughout the book.\nInteracting with Kubernetes through web dashboards\nIf you prefer using graphical web user interfaces, you’ll be happy to hear that Kubernetes also comes with a nice web dashboard. Note, however, that the functionality of the dashboard may lag significantly behind kubectl, which is the primary tool for interacting with Kubernetes.\nNevertheless, the dashboard shows different resources in context and can be a good start to get a feel for what the main resource types in Kubernetes are and how they relate to each other. The dashboard also offers the possibility to modify the deployed objects and displays the equivalent kubectl command for each action - a feature most beginners will appreciate.\nFigure 3.7 shows the dashboard with two workloads deployed in the cluster.\n\nAlthough you won’t use the dashboard in this book, you can always open it to quickly see a graphical view of the objects deployed in your cluster after you create them via kubectl.\nAccessing the dashboard in Docker Desktop\nUnfortunately, Docker Desktop does not install the Kubernetes dashboard by default. Accessing it is also not trivial, but here’s how. First, you need to install it using the following command:\n$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/\n[CA] v2.0.0-rc5/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml\nRefer to github.com/kubernetes/dashboard to find the latest version number. After installing the dashboard, the next command you must run is:\n$ kubectl proxy\nThis command runs a local proxy to the API server, allowing you to access the services through it. Let the proxy process run and use the browser to open the dashboard at the following URL:\nhttp://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/\nYou’ll be presented with an authentication page. You must then run the following command to retrieve an authentication token.\n$ kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard describe secret $(kubectl -n kubernetes-\n[CA] dashboard get secret | sls admin-user | ForEach-Object { $_ -Split\n[CA] '\\s+' } | Select -First 1)\nNOTE\nThis command must be run in Windows PowerShell.\n\nFind the token listed under kubernetes-dashboard-token-xyz and paste it into the token field on the authentication page shown in your browser. After you do this, you should be able to use the dashboard. When you’re finished using it, terminate the kubectl proxy process using Control-C.\nAccessing the dashboard when using Minikube\nIf you’re using Minikube, accessing the dashboard is much easier. Run the following command and the dashboard will open in your default browser:\n$ minikube dashboard\nAccessing the dashboard when running Kubernetes elsewhere\nThe Google Kubernetes Engine no longer provides access to the open source Kubernetes Dashboard, but it offers an alternative web-based console. The same applies to other cloud providers. For information on how to access the dashboard, please refer to the documentation of the respective provider.\nIf your cluster runs on your own infrastructure, you can deploy the dashboard by following the guide at kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard.\n"},"docs/Running_your_first_application_on_Kubernetes.html":{"url":"docs/Running_your_first_application_on_Kubernetes.html","title":"3.3  Running your first application on Kubernetes","keywords":"","body":"3.3 Running your first application on Kubernetes\nNow is the time to finally deploy something to your cluster. Usually, to deploy an application, you’d prepare a JSON or YAML file describing all the components that your application consists of and apply that file to your cluster. This would be the declarative approach.\nSince this may be your first time deploying an application to Kubernetes, let’s choose an easier way to do this. We’ll use simple, one-line imperative commands to deploy your application.\nDeploying your application\nThe imperative way to deploy an application is to use the kubectl create deployment command. As the command itself suggests, it creates a Deployment object, which represents an application deployed in the cluster. By using the imperative command, you avoid the need to know the structure of Deployment objects as when you write YAML or JSON manifests.\nCreating a Deployment\nIn the previous chapter, you created a Node.js application that you packaged into a container image and pushed to Docker Hub to make it easily distributable to any computer. Let’s deploy that application to your Kubernetes cluster. Here’s the command you need to execute:\n$ kubectl create deployment kubia --image=luksa/kubia:1.0\ndeployment.apps/kubia created\nYou’ve specified three things here:\n\nYou want to create a deployment object.\nYou want the object to be called kubia.\nYou want the deployment to use the container image luksa/kubia:1.0.\nBy default, the image is pulled from Docker Hub, but you can also specify the image registry in the image name (for example, quay.io/luksa/kubia:1.0).  \n\nNOTE\nMake sure that the image is stored in a public registry and can be pulled without access authorization. You’ll learn how to provide credentials for pulling private images in chapter 8.\n\nThe Deployment object is now stored in the Kubernetes API. The existence of this object tells Kubernetes that the luksa/kubia:1.0 container must run in your cluster. You’ve stated your desired state. Kubernetes must now ensure that the actual state reflects your wishes.\nListing deployments\nThe interaction with Kubernetes consists mainly of the creation and manipulation of objects via its API. Kubernetes stores these objects and then performs operations to bring them to life. For example, when you create a Deployment object, Kubernetes runs an application. Kubernetes then keeps you informed about the current state of the application by writing the status to the same Deployment object. You can view the status by reading back the object. One way to do this is to list all Deployment objects as follows:\n$ kubectl get deployments\nNAME    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\nkubia   0/1     1            0           6s\nThe kubectl get deployments command lists all Deployment objects that currently exist in the cluster. You have only one Deployment in your cluster. It runs one instance of your application as shown in the UP-TO-DATE column, but the AVAILABLE column indicates that the application is not yet available. That’s because the container isn’t ready, as shown in the READY column. You can see that zero of a total of one container are ready.\nYou may wonder if you can ask Kubernetes to list all the running containers by running kubectl get containers. Let’s try this.\n$ kubectl get containers\nerror: the server doesn't have a resource type \"containers\"\nThe command fails because Kubernetes doesn’t have a “Container” object type. This may seem odd, since Kubernetes is all about running containers, but there’s a twist. A container is not the smallest unit of deployment in Kubernetes. So, what is?\nIntroducing Pods\nIn Kubernetes, instead of deploying individual containers, you deploy groups of co-located containers – so-called pods. You know, as in pod of whales, or a pea pod.\nA pod is a group of one or more closely related containers (not unlike peas in a pod) that run together on the same worker node and need to share certain Linux namespaces, so that they can interact more closely than with other pods.\nIn the previous chapter I showed an example where two processes use the same namespaces. By sharing the network namespace, both processes use the same network interfaces, share the same IP address and port space. By sharing the UTS namespace, both see the same system hostname. This is exactly what happens when you run containers in the same pod. They use the same network and UTS namespaces, as well as others, depending on the pod’s spec.\nFigure 3.8 The relationship between containers, pods, and worker nodes\n\nAs illustrated in figure 3.8, you can think of each pod as a separate logical computer that contains one application. The application can consist of a single process running in a container, or a main application process and additional supporting processes, each running in a separate container. Pods are distributed across all the worker nodes of the cluster.\nEach pod has its own IP, hostname, processes, network interfaces and other resources. Containers that are part of the same pod think that they’re the only ones running on the computer. They don’t see the processes of any other pod, even if located on the same node.\nListing pods\nSince containers aren’t a top-level Kubernetes object, you can’t list them. But you can list pods. As the next listing shows, by creating the Deployment object, you’ve deployed one pod.\nListing 3.11 Listing pods\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nkubia-9d785b578-p449x    0/1       Pending   0          1m\nThis is the pod that houses the container running your application. To be precise, since the status is still Pending, the application, or rather the container, isn’t running yet. This is also expressed in the READY column, which indicates that the pod has a single container that’s not ready.\nThe reason the pod is pending is because the worker node to which the pod has been assigned must first download the container image before it can run it. When the download is complete, the pod’s container is created and the pod enters the Running state.\nIf Kubernetes can’t pull the image from the registry, the kubectl get pods command will indicate this in the STATUS column. If you’re using your own image, ensure it’s marked as public on Docker Hub. Try pulling the image manually with the docker pull command on another computer.\nIf another issue is causing your pod not to run, or if you simply want to see more information about the pod, you can also use the kubectl describe pod command, as you did earlier to see the details of a worker node. If there are any issues with the pod, they should be displayed by this command. Look at the events shown at the bottom of its output. For a running pod, they should be similar to the following listing.\nListing 3.12 The events displayed by kubectl describe pod\nEvents:\nType    Reason     Age   From               Message\n----    ------     ----  ----               -------\nNormal  Scheduled  25s   default-scheduler  Successfully assigned\n                                            default/kubia-9d785b578-p449x\n                                            to worker2\nNormal  Pulling    23s   kubelet, worker2   Pulling image \"luksa/kubia:1.0\"\nNormal  Pulled     21s   kubelet, worker2   Successfully pulled image\nNormal  Created    21s   kubelet, worker2   Created container kubia\nNormal  Started    21s   kubelet, worker2   Started container kubia\nUnderstanding what happens behind the scenes\nTo help you visualize what happened when you created the Deployment, see figure 3.9.\nFigure 3.9 How creating a Deployment object results in a running application container\n\nWhen you ran the kubectl create command, it created a new Deployment object in the cluster by sending an HTTP request to the Kubernetes API server. Kubernetes then created a new Pod object, which was then assigned or scheduled to one of the worker nodes. The Kubernetes agent on the worker node (the Kubelet) became aware of the newly created Pod object, saw that it was scheduled to its node, and instructed Docker to pull the specified image from the registry, create a container from the image, and execute it.\nDEFINITION \nThe term scheduling refers to the assignment of the pod to a node. The pod runs immediately, not at some point in the future. Just like how the CPU scheduler in an operating system selects what CPU to run a process on, the scheduler in Kubernetes decides what worker node should execute each container. Unlike an OS process, once a pod is assigned to a node, it runs only on that node. Even if it fails, this instance of the pod is never moved to other nodes, as is the case with CPU processes, but a new pod instance may be created to replace it.\n\nDepending on what you use to run your Kubernetes cluster, the number of worker nodes in your cluster may vary. The figure shows only the worker node that the pod was scheduled to. In a multi-node cluster, none of the other worker nodes are involved in the process.\nExposing your application to the world\nYour application is now running, so the next question to answer is how to access it. I mentioned that each pod gets its own IP address, but this address is internal to the cluster and not accessible from the outside. To make the pod accessible externally, you’ll expose it by creating a Service object.\nSeveral types of Service objects exist. You decide what type you need. Some expose pods only within the cluster, while others expose them externally. A service with the type LoadBalancer provisions an external load balancer, which makes the service accessible via a public IP. This is the type of service you’ll create now.\nCreating a Service\nThe easiest way to create the service is to use the following imperative command:\n$ kubectl expose deployment kubia --type=LoadBalancer --port 8080\nservice/kubia exposed\nThe create deployment command that you ran previously created a Deployment object, whereas the expose deployment command creates a Service object. This is what running the above command tells Kubernetes:\n\nYou want to expose all pods that belong to the kubia Deployment as a new service.\nYou want the pods to be accessible from outside the cluster via a load balancer.\nThe application listens on port 8080, so you want to access it via that port.\n\nYou didn’t specify a name for the Service object, so it inherits the name of the Deployment.\nListing services\nServices are API objects, just like Pods, Deployments, Nodes and virtually everything else in Kubernetes, so you can list them by executing kubectl get services, as in the next listing.\nListing 3.13 Listing Services\n$ kubectl get svc\nNAME         TYPE          CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)         AGE\nkubernetes   ClusterIP     10.19.240.1            443/TCP         34m\nkubia        LoadBalancer  10.19.243.17        8080:30838/TCP  4s\nNOTE \nNotice the use of the abbreviation svc instead of services. Most resource types have a short name that you can use instead of the full object type (for example, po is short for pods, no for nodes and deploy for deployments).\n\nThe list shows two services with their types, IPs and the ports they expose. Ignore the kubernetes service for now and take a close look at the kubia service. It doesn’t yet have an external IP address. Whether it gets one depends on how you’ve deployed the cluster.\nLISTING THE AVAILABLE OBJECT TYPES WITH KUBECTL API-RESOURCES\nYou’ve used the kubectl get command to list various things in your cluster: Nodes, Deployments, Pods and now Services. These are all Kubernetes object types. You can display a list of all supported types by running kubectl api-resources. The list also shows the short name for each type and some other information you need to define objects in JSON/YAML files, which you’ll learn in the following chapters.\n\nUnderstanding load balancer services\nWhile Kubernetes allows you to create so-called LoadBalancer services, it doesn’t provide the load balancer itself. If your cluster is deployed in the cloud, Kubernetes can ask the cloud infrastructure to provision a load balancer and configure it to forward traffic into your cluster. The infrastructure tells Kubernetes the IP address of the load balancer and this becomes the external address of your service.\nThe process of creating the Service object, provisioning the load balancer and how it forwards connections into the cluster is shown in the next figure.\nFigure 3.10 How creating a Service object with the type LoadBalancer works\n\nProvisioning of the load balancer takes some time, so let’s wait a few more seconds and check again whether the IP address is already assigned. This time, instead of listing all services, you’ll only display the kubia service by using its name, as shown in the next listing.\nListing 3.14 Getting a single service\n$ kubectl get svc kubia\nNAME        TYPE          CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)         AGE\nkubia       LoadBalancer  10.19.243.17  35.246.179.22  8080:30838/TCP  82s\nThe external IP is now displayed. This means that the load balancer is ready to forward requests to your application for clients around the world.\nNOTE\nIf you deployed your cluster with Docker Desktop, the load balancer’s IP address is shown as localhost, referring to your Windows or macOS machine, not the VM where Kubernetes and the application runs. If you use Minikube to create the cluster, no load balancer is created, but you can access the service in another way. More on this later.\n\nAccessing your application through the load balancer\nYou can now send requests to your application through the external IP and port of the service:\n$ curl 35.246.179.22:8080\nHey there, this is kubia-9d785b578-p449x. Your IP is ::ffff:1.2.3.4.\nNOTE\nIf you use Docker Desktop, the service is available at localhost:8080 from within your host operating system. Use curl or your browser to access it.\n\nCongratulations! If you use Google Kubernetes Engine, you’ve successfully published your application to users across the globe. Anyone who knows its IP and port can now access it. If you don’t count the steps needed to deploy the cluster itself, only two simple commands were needed to deploy your application:\n\nkubectl create deployment and\nkubectl expose deployment.\n\nAccessing your application when a load balancer isn’t available\nNot all Kubernetes clusters have mechanisms to provide a load balancer. The cluster provided by Minikube is one of them. If you create a service of type LoadBalancer, the service itself works, but there is no load balancer. Kubectl always shows the external IP as  and you must use a different method to access the service.\nSeveral methods of accessing services exist. You can even bypass the service and access individual pods directly, but this is mostly used for troubleshooting. You’ll learn how to do this in chapter 5. For now, let’s explore the next easier way to access your service if no load balancer is available.\nAs the next listing shows, Minikube can tell you where to access the service:\nListing 3.15 Getting the service URL when using Minikube\n$ minikube service kubia --url\nhttp://192.168.99.102:30838\nThe command prints out the URL of the service. You can now point curl or your browser to that URL to access your application:\n$ curl http://192.168.99.102:30838\nHey there, this is kubia-9d785b578-p449x. Your IP is ::ffff:172.17.0.1.\nTIP\nIf you omit the --url option when running the minikube service command, your browser opens and loads the service URL.\n\nYou may wonder where this IP address and port come from. This is the IP of the Minikube virtual machine. You can confirm this by executing the minikube ip command. The Minikube VM is also your single worker node. The port 30838 is the so-called node port. It’s the port on the worker node that forwards connections to your service. You may have noticed the port in the service’s port list when you ran the kubectl get svc command:\n$ kubectl get svc kubia\nNAME        TYPE          CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)         AGE\nkubia       LoadBalancer  10.19.243.17        8080:30838/TCP  82s\nYour service is accessible via this port number on all your worker nodes, regardless of whether you’re using Minikube or any other Kubernetes cluster.\nNOTE\nIf you use Docker Desktop, the VM running Kubernetes can’t be reached from your host OS through the VM’s IP. You can access the service through the node port only within the VM by logging into it using the special container as described in section 3.1.1.\n\nIf you know the IP of at least one of your worker nodes, you should be able to access your service through this IP:port combination, provided that firewall rules do not prevent you from accessing the port.\nThe next figure shows how external clients access the application via the node ports.\nFigure 3.11 Connection routing through a service’s node port\n\nTo connect this to what I mentioned earlier about the load balancer forwarding connections to the nodes and the nodes then forwarding them to the containers: the node ports are exactly where the load balancer sends incoming requests to. Kubernetes then ensures that they are forwarded to the application running in the container. You’ll learn how it does this in chapter 10, as we delve deeper into services. Don’t lose too much time thinking about it until then. Instead, let’s play a little more with our cluster to see what else Kubernetes can do.\nHorizontally scaling the application\nYou now have a running application that is represented by a Deployment and exposed to the world by a Service object. Now let’s create some additional magic.\nOne of the major benefits of running applications in containers is the ease with which you can scale your application deployments. You’re currently running a single instance of your application. Imagine you suddenly see many more users using your application. The single instance can no longer handle the load. You need to run additional instances to distribute the load and provide service to your users. This is known as scaling out. With Kubernetes, it’s trivial to do.\nIncreasing the number of running application instances\nTo deploy your application, you’ve created a Deployment object. By default, it runs a single instance of your application. To run additional instances, you only need to scale the Deployment object with the following command:\n$ kubectl scale deployment kubia --replicas=3\ndeployment.apps/kubia scaled\nYou’ve now told Kubernetes that you want to run three exact copies or replicas of your pod. Note that you haven’t instructed Kubernetes what to do. You haven’t told it to add two more pods. You just set the new desired number of replicas and let Kubernetes determine what action it must take to reach the new desired state.\nThis is one of the most fundamental principles in Kubernetes. Instead of telling Kubernetes what to do, you simply set a new desired state of the system and let Kubernetes achieve it. To do this, it examines the current state, compares it with the desired state, identifies the differences and determines what it must do to reconcile them.\nSeeing the results of the scale-out\nAlthough it’s true that the kubectl scale deployment command seems imperative, since it apparently tells Kubernetes to scale your application, what the command actually does is modify the specified Deployment object. As you’ll see in a later chapter, you could have simply edited the object instead of giving the imperative command. Let’s view the Deployment object again to see how the scale command has affected it:\n$ kubectl get deploy\nNAME    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\nkubia   3/3     3            3           18m\nThree instances are now up to date and available and three of three containers are ready. This isn’t clear from the command output, but the three containers are not part of the same pod instance. There are three pods with one container each. You can confirm this by listing pods:\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nkubia-9d785b578-58vhc   1/1     Running   0          17s\nkubia-9d785b578-jmnj8   1/1     Running   0          17s\nkubia-9d785b578-p449x   1/1     Running   0          18m\nAs you can see, three pods now exist. As indicated in the READY column, each has a single container, and all the containers are ready. All the pods are Running.\nDisplaying the pods’ host node when listing pods\nIf you use a single-node cluster, all your pods run on the same node. But in a multi-node cluster, the three pods should be distributed throughout the cluster. To see which nodes the pods were scheduled to, you can use the -o wide option to display a more detailed pod list:\n$ kubectl get pods -o wide\nNAME                   ...  IP          NODE\nkubia-9d785b578-58vhc  ...  10.244.1.5  worker1\nkubia-9d785b578-jmnj8  ...  10.244.2.4  worker2\nkubia-9d785b578-p449x  ...  10.244.2.3  worker2\n#A Pod scheduled to one node\n#B Two pods scheduled to another node\nNOTE\nYou can also use the -o wide output option to see additional information when listing other object types.\n\nThe wide output shows that one pod was scheduled to one node, whereas the other two were both scheduled to a different node. The Scheduler usually distributes pods evenly, but it depends on how it’s configured. You’ll learn more about scheduling in chapter 21.\nUNDERSTANDING WHY THE WORKER NODE A POD IS SCHEDULED TO IS NOT IMPORTANT\nRegardless of the node they run on, all instances of your application have an identical OS environment, because they run in containers created from the same container image. You may remember from the previous chapter that the only thing that might be different is the OS kernel, but this only happens when different nodes use different kernel versions or load different kernel modules.\nIn addition, each pod gets its own IP and can communicate in the same way with any other pod - it doesn’t matter if the other pod is on the same worker node, another node located in the same server rack or even a completely different data center.\nSo far, you’ve set no resource requirements for the pods, but if you had, each pod would have been allocated the requested amount of compute resources. It shouldn’t matter to the pod which node provides these resources, as long as the pod’s requirements are met.\nTherefore, you shouldn’t care where a pod is scheduled to. It’s also why the default kubectl get pods command doesn’t display information about the worker nodes for the listed pods. In the world of Kubernetes, it’s just not that important.\n\nAs you can see, scaling an application is incredibly easy. Once your application is in production and there is a need to scale it, you can add additional instances with a single command without having to manually install, configure and run additional copies.\nNOTE\nThe app itself must support horizontal scaling. Kubernetes doesn’t magically make your app scalable; it merely makes it trivial to replicate it.\n\nObserving requests hitting all three pods when using the service\nNow that multiple instances of your app are running, let’s see what happens when you hit the service URL again. Will the response come from the same instance every time? The next listing shows what happens.\nListing 3.16 Requests sent to the service are spread across all the pods\n$ curl 35.246.179.22:8080\nHey there, this is kubia-9d785b578-58vhc. Your IP is ::ffff:1.2.3.4.\n$ curl 35.246.179.22:8080\nHey there, this is kubia-9d785b578-p449x. Your IP is ::ffff:1.2.3.4.\n$ curl 35.246.179.22:8080\nHey there, this is kubia-9d785b578-jmnj8. Your IP is ::ffff:1.2.3.4.\n$ curl 35.246.179.22:8080\nHey there, this is kubia-9d785b578-p449x. Your IP is ::ffff:1.2.3.4.\n#A Request reaches the first pod\n#B Request reaches the third pod\n#C Request reaches the second pod\n#D Request reaches the third pod again\nIf you look closely at the responses, you’ll see that they correspond to the names of the pods. Each request arrives at a different pod in random order. This is what services in Kubernetes do when more than one pod instance is behind them. They act as load balancers in front of the pods. Let’s visualize the system using the following figure.\nFigure 3.12 Load balancing across multiple pods backing the same service\n\nAs the figure shows, you shouldn’t confuse this load balancing mechanism, which is provided by the Kubernetes service itself, with the additional load balancer provided by the infrastructure when running in GKE or another cluster running in the cloud. Even if you use Minikube and have no external load balancer, your requests are still distributed across the three pods by the service itself. If you use GKE, there are actually two load balancers in play. The figure shows that the load balancer provided by the infrastructure distributes requests across the nodes, and the service then distributes requests across the pods.\nI know this may be very confusing right now, but it should all become clear in chapter 10.\nUnderstanding the deployed application\nTo conclude this chapter, let’s review what your system consists of. There are two ways to look at your system – the logical and the physical view. You’ve just seen the physical view in figure 3.12. There are three running containers that are deployed on three worker nodes (a single node when using Minikube). If you run Kubernetes in the cloud, the cloud infrastructure has also created a load balancer for you. Docker Desktop also creates a type of local load balancer. Minikube doesn’t create a load balancer, but you can access your service directly through the node port.\nWhile differences in the physical view of the system in different clusters exist, the logical view is always the same, whether you use a small development cluster or a large production cluster with thousands of nodes. If you’re not the one who manages the cluster, you don’t even need to worry about the physical view of the cluster. If everything works as expected, the logical view is all you need to worry about. Let’s take a closer look at this view.\nUnderstanding the API objects representing your application\nThe logical view consists of the objects you’ve created in the Kubernetes API – either directly or indirectly. The following figure shows how the objects relate to each other.\nFigure 3.13 Your deployed application consists of a Deployment, several Pods, and a Service.\n\nThe objects are as follows:\n\nthe Deployment object you created,\nthe Pod objects that were automatically created based on the Deployment, and\nthe Service object you created manually.\n\nThere are other objects between the three just mentioned, but you don’t need to know them yet. You’ll learn about them in the following chapters.\nRemember when I explained in chapter 1 that Kubernetes abstracts the infrastructure? The logical view of your application is a great example of this. There are no nodes, no complex network topology, no physical load balancers. Just a simple view that only contains your applications and the supporting objects. Let’s look at how these objects fit together and what role they play in your small setup.\nThe Deployment object represents an application deployment. It specifies which container image contains your application and how many replicas of the application Kubernetes should run. Each replica is represented by a Pod object. The Service object represents a single communication entry point to these replicas.\nUnderstanding the pods\nThe essential and most important part of your system are the pods. Each pod definition contains one or more containers that make up the pod. When Kubernetes brings a pod to life, it runs all the containers specified in its definition. As long as a Pod object exists, Kubernetes will do its best to ensure that its containers keep running. It only shuts them down when the Pod object is deleted.\nUnderstanding the role of the Deployment\nWhen you first created the Deployment object, only a single Pod object was created. But when you increased the desired number of replicas on the Deployment, Kubernetes created additional replicas. Kubernetes ensures that the actual number of pods always matches the desired number.\nIf one or more pods disappear or their status is unknown, Kubernetes replaces them to bring the actual number of pods back to the desired number of replicas. A pod disappears when someone or something deletes it, whereas a pod’s status is unknown when the node it is running on no longer reports its status due to a network or node failure.\nStrictly speaking, a Deployment results in nothing more than the creation of a certain number of Pod objects. You may wonder if you can create Pods directly instead of having the Deployment create them for you. You can certainly do this, but if you wanted to run multiple replicas, you’d have to manually create each pod individually and make sure you give each one a unique name. You’d then also have to keep a constant eye on your pods to replace them if they suddenly disappear or the node on which they run fails. And that’s exactly why you almost never create pods directly but use a Deployment instead.\nUnderstanding why you need a service\nThe third component of your system is the Service object. By creating it, you tell Kubernetes that you need a single communication entry point to your pods. The service gives you a single IP address to talk to your pods, regardless of how many replicas are currently deployed. If the service is backed by multiple pods, it acts as a load balancer. But even if there is only one pod, you still want to expose it through a service. To understand why, you need to learn an important detail about pods.\nPods are ephemeral. A pod may disappear at any time. This can happen when its host node fails, when someone inadvertently deletes the pod, or when the pod is evicted from an otherwise healthy node to make room for other, more important pods. As explained in the previous section, when pods are created through a Deployment, a missing pod is immediately replaced with a new one. This new pod is not the same as the one it replaces. It’s a completely new pod, with a new IP address.\nIf you weren’t using a service and had configured your clients to connect directly to the IP of the original pod, you would now need to reconfigure all these clients to connect to the IP of the new pod. This is not necessary when using a service. Unlike pods, services aren’t ephemeral. When you create a service, it is assigned a static IP address that never changes during lifetime of the service.\nInstead of connecting directly to the pod, clients should connect to the IP of the service. This ensures that their connections are always routed to a healthy pod, even if the set of pods behind the service is constantly changing. It also ensures that the load is distributed evenly across all pods should you decide to scale the deployment horizontally.\n"},"docs/Summary_3.html":{"url":"docs/Summary_3.html","title":"3.4 Summary","keywords":"","body":"3.4 Summary\nIn this hands-on chapter, you’ve learned:\n\nVirtually all cloud providers offer a managed Kubernetes option. They take on the burden of maintaining your Kubernetes cluster, while you just use its API to deploy your applications.\nYou can also install Kubernetes in the cloud yourself, but this has often proven not to be the best idea until you master all aspects of managing Kubernetes.\nYou can install Kubernetes locally, even on your laptop, using tools such as Docker Desktop or Minikube, which run Kubernetes in a Linux VM, or kind, which runs the master and worker nodes as Docker containers and the application containers inside those containers.\nKubectl, the command-line tool, is the usual way you interact with Kubernetes. A web-based dashboard also exists but is not as stable and up to date as the CLI tool.\nTo work faster with kubectl, it is useful to define a short alias for it and enable shell completion.\nAn application can be deployed using kubectl create deployment. It can then be exposed to clients by running kubectl expose deployment. Horizontally scaling the application is trivial: kubectl scale deployment instructs Kubernetes to add new replicas or removes existing ones to reach the number of replicas you specify.\nThe basic unit of deployment is not a container, but a pod, which can contain one or more related containers.\nDeployments, Services, Pods and Nodes are Kubernetes objects/resources. You can list them with kubectl get and inspect them with kubectl describe.\nThe Deployment object deploys the desired number of Pods, while the Service object makes them accessible under a single, stable IP address.\nEach service provides internal load balancing in the cluster, but if you set the type of service to LoadBalancer, Kubernetes will ask the cloud infrastructure it runs in for an additional load balancer to make your application available at a publicly accessible address.\n\nYou’ve now completed your first guided tour around the bay. Now it’s time to start learning the ropes, so that you’ll be able to sail independently. The next part of the book focuses on the different Kubernetes objects and how/when to use them. You’ll start with the most important one – the Pod.\n"},"docs/Introducing_the_Kubernetes_API_Objects.html":{"url":"docs/Introducing_the_Kubernetes_API_Objects.html","title":"4.

They include the applications running in the cluster, their configuration, the load balancers through which they are exposed within the cluster or externally, the underlying servers and the storage used by these applications, the security privileges of users and applications, and many other details of the infrastructure.\nFigure 4.1 A Kubernetes cluster is configured by manipulating objects in the Kubernetes API\n\nIntroducing the API\nThe Kubernetes API is the central point of interaction with the cluster, so much of this book is dedicated to explaining this API. The most important API objects are described in the following chapters, but a basic introduction to the API is presented here.\nUnderstanding the architectural style of the API\nThe Kubernetes API is an HTTP-based RESTful API where the state is represented by resources on which you perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using standard HTTP methods such as POST, GET, PUT/PATCH or DELETE.\nDEFINITION\nREST is Representational State Transfer, an architectural style for implementing interoperability between computer systems via web services using stateless operations, described by Roy Thomas Fielding in his doctoral dissertation. To learn more, read the dissertation at https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm.\n\nIt is these resources (or objects) that represent the configuration of the cluster. Cluster administrators and engineers who deploy applications into the cluster therefore influence the configuration by manipulating these objects.\nIn the Kubernetes community, the terms “resource” and “object” are used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences that warrant an explanation.\nUnderstanding the difference between resources and objects\nThe essential concept in RESTful APIs is the resource, and each resource is assigned a URI or Uniform Resource Identifier that uniquely identifies it. For example, in the Kubernetes API, application deployments are represented by deployment resources.\nThe collection of all deployments in the cluster is a REST resource exposed at /api/v1/deployments. When you use the GET method to send an HTTP request to this URI, you receive a response that lists all deployment instances in the cluster.\nEach individual deployment instance also has its own unique URI through which it can be manipulated. The individual deployment is thus exposed as another REST resource. You can retrieve information about the deployment by sending a GET request to the resource URI and you can modify it using a PUT request.\nFigure 4.2 A single object can be exposed by two or more resources\n\nAn object can therefore be exposed through more than one resource. As shown in figure 4.2, the Deployment object instance named mydeploy is returned both as an element of a collection when you query the deployments resource and as a single object when you query the individual resource URI directly.\nIn addition, a single object instance can also be exposed via multiple resources if multiple API versions exist for an object type. Up to Kubernetes version 1.15, two different representations of Deployment objects were exposed by the API. In addition to the apps/v1 version, exposed at /apis/apps/v1/deployments, an older version, extensions/v1beta1, exposed at /apis/extensions/v1beta1/deployments was available in the API. These two resources didn’t represent two different sets of Deployment objects, but a single set that was represented in two different ways - with small differences in the object schema. You could create an instance of a Deployment object via the first URI and then read it back using the second.\nIn some cases, a resource doesn’t represent any object at all. An example of this is the way the Kubernetes API allows clients to verify whether a subject (a person or a service) is authorized to perform an API operation. This is done by submitting a POST request to the /apis/authorization.k8s.io/v1/subjectaccessreviews resource. The response indicates whether the subject is authorized to perform the operation specified in the request body. The key thing here is that no object is created by the POST request.\nThe examples described above show that a resource isn’t the same as an object. If you are familiar with relational database systems, you can compare resources and object types with views and tables. Resources are views through which you interact with objects.\nNOTE\nBecause the term “resource” can also refer to compute resources, such as CPU and memory, to reduce confusion, the term “objects” is used in this book to refer to API resources.\n\nUnderstanding how objects are represented\nWhen you make a GET request for a resource, the Kubernetes API server returns the object in structured text form. The default data model is JSON, but you can also tell the server to return YAML instead. When you update the object using a POST or PUT request, you also specify the new state with either JSON or YAML.\nThe individual fields in an object’s manifest depend on the object type, but the general structure and many fields are shared by all Kubernetes API objects. You’ll learn about them next.\nUnderstanding the structure of an object manifest\nBefore you are confronted with the complete manifest of a Kubernetes object, let me first explain its major parts, because this will help you to find your way through the sometimes hundreds of lines it is composed of.\nIntroducing the main parts of an object\nThe manifest of most Kubernetes API objects consists of the following four sections:\n\nType Metadata contains information about the type of object this manifest describes. It specifies the object type, the group to which the type belongs, and the API version.\nObject Metadata holds the basic information about the object instance, including its name, time of creation, owner of the object, and other identifying information. The fields in the Object Metadata are the same for all object types.\nSpec is the part in which you specify the desired state of the object. Its fields differ between different object types. For pods, this is the part that specifies the pod’s containers, storage volumes and other information related to its operation.\nStatus contains the current actual state of the object. For a pod, it tells you the condition of the pod, the status of each of its containers, its IP address, the node it’s running on, and other information that reveals what’s happening to your pod.\n\nA visual representation of an object manifest and its four sections is shown in the next figure.\nFigure 4.3 The main sections of a Kubernetes API object.\n\nNOTE\nAlthough the figure shows that users write to the object’s Spec section and read its Status, the API server always returns the entire object when you perform a GET request; to update the object, you also send the entire object in the PUT request.\n\nYou’ll see an example later to see which fields exist in these sections but let me first explain the Spec and Status sections, as they represent the flesh of the object.\nUnderstanding the spec and status sections\nAs you may have noticed in the previous figure, the two most important parts of an object are the Spec and Status sections. You use the Spec to specify the desired state of the object and read the actual state of the object from the Status section. So, you are the one who writes the Spec and reads the Status, but who or what reads the Spec and writes the Status?\nThe Kubernetes Control Plane runs several components called controllers that manage the objects you create. Each controller is usually only responsible for one object type. For example, the Deployment controller manages Deployment objects.\nAs shown in figure 4.4, the task of a controller is to read the desired object state from the object’s Spec section, perform the actions required to achieve this state, and report back the actual state of the object by writing to its Status section.\nFigure 4.4 How a controller manages an object\n\nEssentially, you tell Kubernetes what it has to do by creating and updating API objects. Kubernetes controllers use the same API objects to tell you what they have done and what the status of their work is.\nYou’ll learn more about the individual controllers and their responsibilities in chapter 13. For now, just remember that a controller is associated with most object types and that the controller is the thing that reads the Spec and writes the Status of the object.\nNot all objects have the spec and status sections\nAll Kubernetes API objects contain the two metadata sections, but not all have the Spec and Status sections. Those that don’t, typically contain just static data and don’t have a corresponding controller, so it is not necessary to distinguish between the desired and the actual state of the object.\nAn example of such an object is the Event object, which is created by various controllers to provide additional information about what is happening with an object that the controller is managing. The Event object is explained in section 4.3.\nYou now understand the general outline of an object, so the next section of this chapter can finally explore the individual fields of an object.\n"},"docs/Examining_an_objects_individual_properties.html":{"url":"docs/Examining_an_objects_individual_properties.html","title":"4.2 Examining an object’s individual properties","keywords":"","body":"4.2 Examining an object’s individual properties\nTo examine Kubernetes API objects up close, we’ll need a concrete example. Let’s take the Node object, which should be easy to understand because it represents something you might be relatively familiar with - a computer in the cluster.\nMy Kubernetes cluster provisioned by the kind tool has three nodes - one master and two workers. They are represented by three Node objects in the API. I can query the API and list these objects using kubectl get nodes, as shown in the next listing.\nListing 4.1 Listing Node objects\n$ kubectl get nodes\nNAME                 STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION\nkind-control-plane   Ready    master   1h     v1.18.2\nkind-worker          Ready       1h     v1.18.2\nkind-worker2         Ready       1h     v1.18.2\n\nThe following figure shows the three Node objects and the actual cluster machines that make up the cluster. Each Node object instance represents one host. In each instance, the Spec section contains (part of) the configuration of the host, and the Status section contains the state of the host.\nFigure 4.5 Cluster nodes are represented by Node objects\n\nNOTE\nNode objects are slightly different from other objects because they are usually created by the Kubelet - the node agent running on the cluster node - rather than by users. When you add a machine to the cluster, the Kubelet registers the node by creating a Node object that represents the host. Users can then edit (some of) the fields in the Spec section.\n\nExploring the full manifest of a Node object\nLet’s take a close look at one of the Node objects. List all Node objects in your cluster by running the kubectl get nodes command and select one you want to inspect. Then, execute the kubectl get node  -o yaml command, where you replace  with the name of the node, as shown in the following listing.\nListing 4.2 Displaying the complete YAML manifest of an object\n$ kubectl get node kind-control-plane -o yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Node\nmetadata:\n  annotations: ...\n  creationTimestamp: \"2020-05-03T15:09:17Z\"\n  labels: ...\n  managedFields: ...\n  name: kind-control-plane                                    #C\n  resourceVersion: \"3220054\"\n  selfLink: /api/v1/nodes/kind-control-plane\n  uid: 16dc1e0b-8d34-4cfb-8ade-3b0e91ec838b\nspec:\n  podCIDR: 10.244.0.0/24                                      #E\n  podCIDRs:                                                   #E\n  - 10.244.0.0/24                                             #E\n  taints:\n  - effect: NoSchedule\n    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master\nstatus:\n  addresses:                                                  #G\n  - address: 172.18.0.2                                       #G\n    type: InternalIP                                          #G\n  - address: kind-control-plane                               #G\n    type: Hostname                                            #G\n  allocatable: ...\n  capacity:                                                   #H\n    cpu: \"8\"                                                  #H\n    ephemeral-storage: 401520944Ki                            #H\n    hugepages-1Gi: \"0\"                                        #H\n    hugepages-2Mi: \"0\"                                        #H\n    memory: 32720824Ki                                        #H\n    pods: \"110\"                                               #H\n  conditions:\n  - lastHeartbeatTime: \"2020-05-17T12:28:41Z\"\n    lastTransitionTime: \"2020-05-03T15:09:17Z\"\n    message: kubelet has sufficient memory available\n    reason: KubeletHasSufficientMemory\n    status: \"False\"\n    type: MemoryPressure\n    ...\n  daemonEndpoints:\n    kubeletEndpoint:\n      Port: 10250\n  images:                                                     #I\n  - names:                                                    #I\n    - k8s.gcr.io/etcd:3.4.3-0                                 #I\n    sizeBytes: 289997247                                      #I\n    ...                                                       #I\n  nodeInfo:                                                   #J\n    architecture: amd64                                       #J\n    bootID: 233a359f-5897-4860-863d-06546130e1ff              #J\n    containerRuntimeVersion: containerd://1.3.3-14-g449e9269  #J\n    kernelVersion: 5.5.10-200.fc31.x86_64                     #J\n    kubeProxyVersion: v1.18.2                                 #J\n    kubeletVersion: v1.18.2                                   #J\n    machineID: 74b74e389bb246e99abdf731d145142d               #J\n    operatingSystem: linux                                    #J\n    osImage: Ubuntu 19.10                                     #J\n    systemUUID: 8749f818-8269-4a02-bdc2-84bf5fa21700          #J\n\nNOTE\nUse the -o json option to display the object in JSON instead of YAML.\n\nIn the listing, the four main sections of the object definition and the more important properties of the node are annotated to help you distinguish between the more and less important fields. Some lines have been omitted to reduce the length of the manifest.\nAccessing the API directly\nYou may be interested in trying to access the API directly instead of through kubectl. As explained earlier, the Kubernetes API is web based, so you can use a web browser or the curl command to perform API operations, but the API server uses TLS and you typically need a client certificate or token for authentication. Fortunately, kubectl provides a special proxy that takes care of this, allowing you to talk to the API through the proxy using plain HTTP.\nTo run the proxy, execute the command:\n$ kubectl proxy\n\nStarting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8001\nYou can now access the API using HTTP at 127.0.0.1:8001. For example, to retrieve the node object, open the URL http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/nodes/kind-control-plane (replace kind-control-plane with one of your nodes’ names).\nNow let’s take a closer look at the fields in each of the four main sections.\nThe Type Metadata fields\nAs you can see, the listing starts with the apiVersion and kind fields, which specify the API version and type of the object that this object manifest specifies. The API version is the schema used to describe this object. As mentioned before, an object type can be associated with more than one schema, with different fields in each schema being used to describe the object. However, usually only one schema exists for each type.\nThe apiVersion in the previous listing is simply v1, but you’ll see in the following chapters that the apiVersion in other object types contains more than just the version number. For Deployment objects, for example, the apiVersion is apps/v1. Whereas the field was originally used only to specify the API version, it is now also used to specify the API group to which the resource belongs. Node objects belong to the core API group, which is conventionally omitted from the apiVersion field.\nThe type of object defined in the manifest is specified by the field kind. The object kind in the previous listing is Node, and so far in this book you’ve also dealt with the following kinds: Deployment, Service, and Pod.\nFields in the Object Metadata section\nThe metadata section contains the metadata of this object instance. It contains the name of the instance, along with additional attributes such as labels and annotations, which are explained in chapter 9, and fields such as resourceVersion, managedFields, and other low-level fields, which are explained at depth in chapter 12.\nFields in the Spec section\nNext comes the spec section, which is specific to each object kind. It is relatively short for Node objects compared to what you find for other object kinds. The podCIDR fields specify the pod IP range assigned to the node. Pods running on this node are assigned IPs from this range. The taints field is not important at this point, but you’ll learn about it in chapter 18.\nTypically, an object’s spec section contains many more fields that you use to configure the object.\nFields in the Status section\nThe status section also differs between the different kinds of object, but its purpose is always the same - it contains the last observed state of the thing the object represents. For Node objects, the status reveals the node’s IP address(es), host name, capacity to provide compute resources, the current conditions of the node, the container images it has already downloaded and which are now cached locally, and information about its operating system and the version of Kubernetes components running on it.\nUnderstanding individual object fields\nTo learn more about individual fields in the manifest, you can refer to the API reference documentation at http://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/ or use the kubectl explain command as described next.\nUsing kubectl explain to explore API object fields\nThe kubectl tool has a nice feature that allows you to look up the explanation of each field for each object type (kind) from the command line. Usually, you start by asking it to provide the basic description of the object kind by running kubectl explain , as shown here:\nListing 4.3 Using kubectl explain to learn about an object kind\n$ kubectl explain nodes\nKIND:     Node\nVERSION:  v1\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n     Node is a worker node in Kubernetes. Each node will have a unique\n     identifier in the cache (i.e. in etcd).\n\nFIELDS:\n   apiVersion   \n     APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an\n     object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest...\n\n   kind \n     Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object\n     represents.

More info: ...\n\nThe command prints the explanation of the object and lists the top-level fields that the object can contain.\nDrilling deeper into an API object’s structure\nYou can then drill deeper to find subfields under each specific field. For example, you can use the following command to explain the node’s spec field:\nListing 4.4 Using kubectl explain to learn about a specific object field and sub-fields\n$ kubectl explain node.spec\nKIND:     Node\nVERSION:  v1\n\nRESOURCE: spec \n\nDESCRIPTION:\n     Spec defines the behavior of a node.\n\n     NodeSpec describes the attributes that a node is created with.\n\nFIELDS:\n   configSource \n     If specified, the source to get node configuration from The\n     DynamicKubeletConfig feature gate must be enabled for the Kubelet...\n\n   externalID   \n     Deprecated. Not all kubelets will set this field...\n\n   podCIDR      \n     PodCIDR represents the pod IP range assigned to the node.    \n\n   ...\n\nPlease note the API version given at the top. As explained earlier, multiple versions of the same kind can exist. Different versions can have different fields or default values. If you want to display a different version, specify it with the --api-version option.\nNOTE\nIf you want to see the complete structure of an object (the complete hierarchical list of fields without the descriptions), try kubectl explain pods --recursive.\n\nUnderstanding an object’s status conditions\nThe set of fields in both the spec and status sections is different for each object kind, but the conditions field is found in many of them. It gives a list of conditions the object is currently in. They are very useful when you need to troubleshoot an object, so let’s examine them more closely. Since the Node object is used as an example, this section also teaches you how to easily identify problems with a cluster node.\nIntroducing the node’s status conditions\nLet’s print out the YAML manifest of the one of the node objects again, but this time we’ll only focus on the conditions field in the object’s status, as shown in the following listing.\nListing 4.5 The current status conditions in a Node object\n$ kubectl get node kind-control-plane -o yaml\n...\nstatus:\n  ...\n  conditions:\n  - lastHeartbeatTime: \"2020-05-17T13:03:42Z\"\n    lastTransitionTime: \"2020-05-03T15:09:17Z\"\n    message: kubelet has sufficient memory available\n    reason: KubeletHasSufficientMemory\n    status: \"False\"\n    type: MemoryPressure\n  - lastHeartbeatTime: \"2020-05-17T13:03:42Z\"\n    lastTransitionTime: \"2020-05-03T15:09:17Z\"\n    message: kubelet has no disk pressure\n    reason: KubeletHasNoDiskPressure\n    status: \"False\"\n    type: DiskPressure\n  - lastHeartbeatTime: \"2020-05-17T13:03:42Z\"\n    lastTransitionTime: \"2020-05-03T15:09:17Z\"\n    message: kubelet has sufficient PID available\n    reason: KubeletHasSufficientPID\n    status: \"False\"\n    type: PIDPressure\n  - lastHeartbeatTime: \"2020-05-17T13:03:42Z\"\n    lastTransitionTime: \"2020-05-03T15:10:15Z\"\n    message: kubelet is posting ready status\n    reason: KubeletReady\n    status: \"True\"\n    type: Ready\n\nTIP\nThe jq tool is very handy if you want to see only a part of the object’s structure. For example, to display the node’s status conditions, you can run kubectl get node  -o json | jq .status.conditions. The equivalent tool for YAML is yq.\n\nThere are four conditions that reveal the state of the node. Each condition has a type and a status field, which can be True, False or Unknown, as shown in the figure 4.6. A condition can also specify a machine-facing reason for the last transition of the condition and a human-facing message with details about the transition. The lastTransitionTime field indicates when the condition moved from one status to another, whereas the lastHeartbeatTime field reveals the last time the controller received an update on the given condition.\nFigure 4.6 The status conditions indicating the state of a Node object\n\nAlthough it’s the last condition in the list, the Ready condition is probably the most important, as it signals whether the node is ready to accept new workloads (pods). The other conditions (MemoryPressure, DiskPressure and PIDPressure) signal whether the node is running out of resources. Remember to check these conditions if a node starts to behave strangely - for example, if the applications running on it start running out of resources and/or crash.\nUnderstanding conditions in other object kinds\nA condition list such as that in Node objects is also used in many other object kinds. The conditions explained earlier are a good example of why the state of most objects is represented by multiple conditions instead of a single field.\nNOTE\nConditions are usually orthogonal, meaning that they represent unrelated aspects of the object.\n\nIf the state of an object were represented as a single field, it would be very difficult to subsequently extend it with new values, as this would require updating all clients that monitor the state of the object and perform actions based on it. Some object kinds originally used such a single field, and some still do, but most now use a list of conditions instead.\nSince the focus of this chapter is to introduce the common features of the Kubernetes API objects, we’ve focused only on the conditions field, but it is far from being the only field in the status of the Node object. To explore the others, use the kubectl explain command as described in the previous sidebar. The fields that are not immediately easy for you to understand should become clear to you after reading the remaining chapters in this part of the book.\nNOTE\nAs an exercise, use the command kubectl get   -o yaml to explore the other objects you’ve created so far (deployments, services, and pods).\n\nInspecting objects using the kubectl describe command\nTo give you a correct impression of the entire structure of the Kubernetes API objects, it was necessary to show you the complete YAML manifest of an object. While I personally often use this method to inspect an object, a more user-friendly way to inspect an object is the kubectl describe command, which typically displays the same information or sometimes even more.\nUnderstanding the kubectl describe output for a Node object\nLet’s try running the kubectl describe command on a Node object. To keep things interesting, let’s now take one of the worker nodes instead of the master. The following listing shows what the kubectl describe command displays for one of my two worker nodes.\nListing 4.6 Inspecting a Node object with kubectl describe\n$ kubectl describe node kind-worker-2\nName:               kind-worker2\nRoles:              \nLabels:             beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64\n                    beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux\n                    kubernetes.io/arch=amd64\n                    kubernetes.io/hostname=kind-worker2\n                    kubernetes.io/os=linux\nAnnotations:        kubeadm.alpha.kubernetes.io/cri-socket: /run/contain...\n                    node.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl: 0\n                    volumes.kubernetes.io/controller-managed-attach-deta...\nCreationTimestamp:  Sun, 03 May 2020 17:09:48 +0200\nTaints:             \nUnschedulable:      false\nLease:\n  HolderIdentity:  kind-worker2\n  AcquireTime:     \n  RenewTime:       Sun, 17 May 2020 16:15:03 +0200\nConditions:\n  Type             Status  ...

You can see the name, IP address, and hostname, as well as the conditions and available capacity of the node.\nInspecting other objects related to the Node\nIn addition to the information stored in the Node object itself, the kubectl describe command also displays the pods running on the node and the total amount of compute resources allocated to them. Below is also a list of events related to the node.\nThis additional information isn’t found in the Node object itself, but is collected by the kubectl tool from other API objects. For example, the list of pods running on the node is obtained by retrieving Pod objects via the pods resource.\nIf you run the describe command yourself, no events may be displayed. This is because only events that have occurred recently are shown. For Node objects, unless the node has resource capacity issues, you’ll only see events if you’ve recently (re)started the node.\nVirtually every API object kind has events associated with it. Since they are crucial for debugging a cluster, they warrant a closer look before you start exploring other objects.\n"},"docs/Observing_cluster_events_via_Event_objects.html":{"url":"docs/Observing_cluster_events_via_Event_objects.html","title":"4.3 Observing cluster events via Event objects","keywords":"","body":"4.3 Observing cluster events via Event objects\nAs controllers perform their task of reconciling the actual state of an object with the desired state, as specified in the object’s spec field, they generate events to reveal what they have done. Two types of events exist: Normal and Warning. Events of the latter type are usually generated by controllers when something prevents them from reconciling the object. By monitoring this type of events, you can be quickly informed of any problems that the cluster encounters.\nIntroducing the Event object\nLike everything else in Kubernetes, events are represented by Event objects that are created and read via the Kubernetes API. As the following figure shows, they contain information about what happened to the object and what the source of the event was. Unlike other objects, each Event object is deleted one hour after its creation to reduce the burden on etcd, the data store for Kubernetes API objects.\nFigure 4.7 The relationship between Event objects, controllers, and other API objects.\n\nNOTE\nThe amount of time to retain events is configurable via the API server’s command-line options.\n\nListing events using kubectl get events\nThe events displayed by kubectl describe refer to the object you specify as the argument to the command. Due to their nature and the fact that many events can be created for an object in a short time, they aren’t part of the object itself. You won’t find them in the object’s YAML manifest, as they exist on their own, just like Nodes and the other objects you’ve seen so far.\nNOTE\nIf you want to follow the exercises in this section in your own cluster, you may need to restart one of the nodes to ensure that the events are recent enough to still be present in etcd. If you can’t do this, don’t worry, and just skip doing these exercises yourself, as you’ll also be generating and inspecting events in the exercises in the next chapter.\n\nBecause Events are standalone objects, you can list them using kubectl get events, as shown in the next listing.\nListing 4.7 Listing events using kubectl get events\n$ kubectl get ev\nLAST\nSEEN  TYPE    REASON                   OBJECT             MESSAGE\n48s   Normal  Starting                 node/kind-worker2  Starting kubelet.\n48s   Normal  NodeAllocatableEnforced  node/kind-worker2  Updated Node A...\n48s   Normal  NodeHasSufficientMemory  node/kind-worker2  Node kind-work...\n48s   Normal  NodeHasNoDiskPressure    node/kind-worker2  Node kind-work...\n48s   Normal  NodeHasSufficientPID     node/kind-worker2  Node kind-work...\n47s   Normal  Starting                 node/kind-worker2  Starting kube-...\n\nNOTE\nThe previous listing uses the short name ev in place of events.\n\nYou’ll notice that some events displayed in the listing match the status conditions of the Node. This is often the case, but you’ll also find additional events. The two events with the reason Starting are two such examples. In the case at hand, they signal that the Kubelet and the Kube Proxy components have been started on the node. You don’t need to worry about these components yet. They are explained in the third part of the book.\nUnderstanding what’s in an Event object\nAs with other objects, the kubectl get command only outputs the most important object data. To display additional information, you can enable additional columns by executing the command with the -o wide option:\n$ kubectl get ev -o wide\n\nThe output of this command is extremely wide and is not listed here in the book. Instead, the information that is displayed is explained in the following table.\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nName\nThe name of this Event object instance. Useful only if you want to retrieve the given object from the API.\n\n\nType\nThe type of the event. Either Normal or Warning.\n\n\nReason\nThe machine-facing description why the event occurred.\n\n\nSource\nThe component that reported this event. This is usually a controller.\n\n\nObject\nThe object instance to which the event refers. For example, node/xyz.\n\n\nSub-object\nThe sub-object to which the event refers. For example, what container of the pod.\n\n\nMessage\nThe human-facing description of the event.\n\n\nFirst seen\nThe first time this event occurred. Remember that each Event object is deleted after a while, so this may not be the first time that the event actually occurred.\n\n\nLast seen\nEvents often occur repeatedly. This field indicates when this event last occurred.\n\n\nCount\nThe number of times this event has occurred.\n\n\n\nTable 4.1 Properties of the Event object\nTIP\nAs you complete the exercises throughout this book, you may find it useful to run the kubectl get events command each time you make changes to one of your objects. This will help you learn what happens beneath the surface.\n\nDisplaying only warning events\nUnlike the kubectl describe command, which only displays events related to the object you’re describing, the kubectl get events command displays all events. This is useful if you want to check if there are events that you should be concerned about. You may want to ignore events of type Normal and focus only on those of type Warning.\nThe API provides a way to filter objects through a mechanism called field selectors. Only objects where the specified field matches the specified selector value are returned. You can use this to display only Warning events. The kubectl get command allows you to specify the field selector with the --field-selector option. To list only events that represent warnings, you execute the following command:\n$ kubectl get ev --field-selector type=Warning\nNo resources found in default namespace.\n\nIf the command does not print any events, as in the above case, no warnings have been recorded in your cluster recently.\nYou may wonder how I knew the exact name of the field to be used in the field selector and what its exact value should be (perhaps it should have been lower case, for example). Hats off if you guessed that this information is provided by the kubectl explain events command. Since events are regular API objects, you can use it to look up documentation on the event objects’ structure. There you’ll learn that the type field can have two values: either Normal or Warning.\nExamining the YAML of the Event object\nTo inspect the events in your cluster, the commands kubectl describe and kubectl get events should be sufficient. Unlike other objects, you’ll probably never have to display the complete YAML of an Event object. But I’d like to take this opportunity to show you an annoying thing about Kubernetes object manifests that the API returns.\nEvent objects have no spec and status sections\nIf you use the kubectl explain to explore the structure of the Event object, you’ll notice that it has no spec or status sections. Unfortunately, this means that its fields are not as nicely organized as in the Node object, for example.\nInspect the following listing and see if you can easily find the object kind, metadata and other fields.\nListing 4.8 The YAML manifest of an Event object\napiVersion: v1\ncount: 1\neventTime: null\nfirstTimestamp: \"2020-05-17T18:16:40Z\"\ninvolvedObject:\n  kind: Node\n  name: kind-worker2\n  uid: kind-worker2\nkind: Event\nlastTimestamp: \"2020-05-17T18:16:40Z\"\nmessage: Starting kubelet.\nmetadata:\n  creationTimestamp: \"2020-05-17T18:16:40Z\"\n  managedFields:\n  - ...\n  name: kind-worker2.160fe38fc0bc3703             #D\n  namespace: default\n  resourceVersion: \"3528471\"\n  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/events/kind-worker2.160f...\n  uid: da97e812-d89e-4890-9663-091fd1ec5e2d\nreason: Starting\nreportingComponent: \"\"\nreportingInstance: \"\"\nsource:\n  component: kubelet\n  host: kind-worker2\ntype: Normal\n\nYou will surely agree that the YAML manifest in the listing is disorganized. The fields are listed alphabetically instead of being organized into coherent groups. This makes it difficult for us humans to read. It looks so chaotic that it’s no wonder that many people hate to deal with Kubernetes YAML or JSON manifests, since both suffer from this problem.\nIn contrast, the earlier YAML manifest of the Node object was relatively easy to read, because the order of the top-level fields is what one would expect: apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec, and status. You’ll notice that this is simply because the alphabetical order of the five fields just happens to make sense. But the fields under those fields suffer from the same problem, as they are also sorted alphabetically.\nYAML is supposed to be easy for people to read, but the alphabetical field order in Kubernetes YAML breaks this. Fortunately, most objects contain the spec and status sections, so at least the top-level fields in these objects are well organized. As for the rest, you’ll just have to accept this unfortunate aspect of dealing with Kubernetes manifests.\n"},"docs/Summary_4.html":{"url":"docs/Summary_4.html","title":"4.4 Summary","keywords":"","body":"4.4 Summary\nIn this chapter, you’ve learned:\n\nKubernetes provides a RESTful API for interaction with a cluster. API Objects map to actual components that make up the cluster, including applications, load balancers, nodes, storage volumes, and many others.\nAn object instance can be represented by many resources. A single object type can be exposed through several resources that are just different representations of the same thing.\nKubernetes API objects are described in YAML or JSON manifests. Objects are created by posting a manifest to the API. The status of the object is stored in the object itself and can be retrieved by requesting the object from the API with a GET request.\nAll Kubernetes API objects contain Type and Object Metadata, and most have a spec and status sections. A few object types don’t have these two sections, because they only contain static data.\nControllers bring objects to life by constantly watching for changes in their spec, updating the cluster state and reporting the current state via the object’s status field.\nAs controllers manage Kubernetes API objects, they emit events to reveal what actions they have performed. Like everything else, events are represented by Event objects and can be retrieved through the API. Events signal what is happening to a Node or other object. They show what has recently happened to the object and can provide clues as to why it is broken.\nThe kubectl explain command provides a quick way to look up documentation on a specific object kind and its fields from the command line.\nThe status in a Node object contains information about the node’s IP address and hostname, its resource capacity, conditions, cached container images and other information about the node. Which pods are running on the node is not part of the node’s status, but the kubectl describe node commands gets this information from the pods resource.\nMany object types use status conditions to signal the state of the component that the object represents. For nodes, these conditions are MemoryPressure, DiskPressure and PIDPressure. Each condition is either True, False, or Unknown and has an associated reason and message that explain why the condition is in the specified state.\n\nYou should now be familiar with the general structure of the Kubernetes API objects. In the next chapter, you’ll learn about the Pod object, the fundamental building block which represents one running instance of your application.\n"},"docs/Running_applications_in_Pods.html":{"url":"docs/Running_applications_in_Pods.html","title":"5.

In this and the following chapters, you’ll learn about the specifics of each of them and many others that are typically used to deploy a full application. Let’s start with the Pod object, as it represents the central, most important concept in Kubernetes - a running instance of your application.\n"},"docs/Understanding_pods.html":{"url":"docs/Understanding_pods.html","title":"5.1  Understanding pods","keywords":"","body":"5.1 Understanding pods\nYou’ve already learned that a pod is a co-located group of containers and the basic building block in Kubernetes. Instead of deploying containers individually, you deploy and manage a group of containers as a single unit — a pod. Although pods may contain several, it’s not uncommon for a pod to contain just a single container. When a pod has multiple containers, all of them run on the same worker node — a single pod instance never spans multiple nodes. Figure 5.2 will help you visualize this information.\nFigure 5.2 All containers of a pod run on the same node. A pod never spans multiple nodes.\n\nUnderstanding why we need pods\nLet’s discuss why we need to run multiple containers together, as opposed to, for example, running multiple processes in the same container.\nUnderstanding why one container shouldn’t contain multiple processes\nImagine an application that consists of several processes that communicate with each other via IPC (Inter-Process Communication) or shared files, which requires them to run on the same computer. In chapter 2, you learned that each container is like an isolated computer or virtual machine. A computer typically runs several processes; containers can also do this. You can run all the processes that make up an application in just one container, but that makes the container very difficult to manage.\nContainers are designed to run only a single process, not counting any child processes that it spawns. Both container tooling and Kubernetes were developed around this fact. For example, a process running in a container is expected to write its logs to standard output. Docker and Kubernetes commands that you use to display the logs only show what has been captured from this output. If a single process is running in the container, it’s the only writer, but if you run multiple processes in the container, they all write to the same output. Their logs are therefore intertwined, and it is difficult to tell which process each logged line belongs to.\nAnother indication that containers should only run a single process is the fact that the container runtime only restarts the container when the container’s root process dies. It doesn’t care about any child processes created by this root process. If it spawns child processes, it alone is responsible for keeping all these processes running.\nTo take full advantage of the features provided by the container runtime, you should consider running only one process in each container.\nUnderstanding how a pod combines multiple containers\nSince you shouldn’t run multiple processes in a single container, it’s evident you need another higher-level construct that allows you to run related processes together even when divided into multiple containers. These processes must be able to communicate with each other like processes in a normal computer. And that is why pods were introduced.\nWith a pod, you can run closely related processes together, giving them (almost) the same environment as if they were all running in a single container. These processes are somewhat isolated, but not completely - they share some resources. This gives you the best of both worlds. You can use all the features that containers offer, but also allow processes to work together. A pod makes these interconnected containers manageable as one unit.\nIn the second chapter, you learned that a container uses its own set of Linux namespaces, but it can also share some with other containers. This sharing of namespaces is exactly how Kubernetes and the container runtime combine containers into pods.\nAs shown in figure 5.3, all containers in a pod share the same Network namespace and thus the network interfaces, IP address(es) and port space that belong to it.\nFigure 5.3 Containers in a pod share the same network interfaces\n\nBecause of the shared port space, processes running in containers of the same pod can’t be bound to the same port numbers, whereas processes in other pods have their own network interfaces and port spaces, eliminating port conflicts between different pods.\nAll the containers in a pod also see the same system hostname, because they share the UTS namespace, and can communicate through the usual IPC mechanisms because they share the IPC namespace. A pod can also be configured to use a single PID namespace for all its containers, which makes them share a single process tree, but you must explicitly enable this for each pod individually.\nNOTE \nWhen containers of the same pod use separate PID namespaces, they can’t see each other or send process signals like SIGTERM or SIGINT between them.\n\nIt’s this sharing of certain namespaces that gives the processes running in a pod the impression that they run together, even though they run in separate containers.\nIt’s this sharing of certain namespaces that gives the processes running in a pod the impression that they run together, even though they run in separate containers.\nIn contrast, each container always has its own Mount namespace, giving it its own file system, but when two containers must share a part of the file system, you can add a volume to the pod and mount it into both containers. The two containers still use two separate Mount namespaces, but the shared volume is mounted into both. You’ll learn more about volumes in chapter 7.\nOrganizing containers into pods\nYou can think of each pod as a separate computer. Unlike virtual machines, which typically host multiple applications, you typically run only one application in each pod. You never need to combine multiple applications in a single pod, as pods have almost no resource overhead. You can have as many pods as you need, so instead of stuffing all your applications into a single pod, you should divide them so that each pod runs only closely related application processes.\nLet me illustrate this with a concrete example.\nSplitting a multi-tier application stack into multiple pods\nImagine a simple system composed of a front-end web server and a back-end database. I’ve already explained that the front-end server and the database shouldn’t run in the same container, as all the features built into containers were designed around the expectation that not more than one process runs in a container. If not in a single container, should you then run them in separate containers that are all in the same pod?\nAlthough nothing prevents you from running both the front-end server and the database in a single pod, this isn’t the best approach. I’ve explained that all containers of a pod always run co-located, but do the web server and the database have to run on the same computer? The answer is obviously no, as they can easily communicate over the network. Therefore you shouldn’t run them in the same pod.\nIf both the front-end and the back-end are in the same pod, both run on the same cluster node. If you have a two-node cluster and only create this one pod, you are using only a single worker node and aren’t taking advantage of the computing resources available on the second node. This means wasted CPU, memory, disk storage and bandwidth. Splitting the containers into two pods allows Kubernetes to place the front-end pod on one node and the back-end pod on the other, thereby improving the utilization of your hardware.\nSplitting into multiple pods to enable individual scaling\nAnother reason not to use a single pod has to do with horizontal scaling. A pod is not only the basic unit of deployment, but also the basic unit of scaling. In chapter 2 you scaled the Deployment object and Kubernetes created additional pods – additional replicas of your application. Kubernetes doesn’t replicate containers within a pod. It replicates the entire pod.\nFront-end components usually have different scaling requirements than back-end components, so we typically scale them individually. When your pod contains both the front-end and back-end containers and Kubernetes replicates it, you end up with multiple instances of both the front-end and back-end containers, which isn’t always what you want. Stateful back-ends, such as databases, usually can’t be scaled. At least not as easily as stateless front ends. If a container has to be scaled separately from the other components, this is a clear indication that it must be deployed in a separate pod.\nThe following figure illustrates what was just explained.\nFigure 5.4 Splitting an application stack into pods\n\nSplitting application stacks into multiple pods is the correct approach. But then, when does one run multiple containers in the same pod?\nIntroducing sidecar containers\nPlacing several containers in a single pod is only appropriate if the application consists of a primary process and one or more processes that complement the operation of the primary process. The container in which the complementary process runs is called a sidecar container because it’s analogous to a motorcycle sidecar, which makes the motorcycle more stable and offers the possibility of carrying an additional passenger. But unlike motorcycles, a pod can have more than one sidecar, as shown in figure 5.5.\nFigure 5.5 A pod with a primary and sidecar container(s)\nIt’s difficult to imagine what constitutes a complementary process, so I’ll give you some examples. In chapter 2, you deployed pods with one container that runs a Node.js application. The Node.js application only supports the HTTP protocol. To make it support HTTPS, we could add a bit more JavaScript code, but we can also do it without changing the existing application at all - by adding an additional container to the pod – a reverse proxy that converts HTTPS traffic to HTTP and forwards it to the Node.js container. The Node.js container is thus the primary container, whereas the container running the proxy is the sidecar container. Figure 5.6 shows this example.\nFigure 5.6 A sidecar container that converts HTTPS traffic to HTTP\n\nNOTE\nYou’ll create this pod in section 5.4.\n\nAnother example, shown in figure 5.7, is a pod where the primary container runs a web server that serves files from its webroot directory. The other container in the pod is an agent that periodically downloads content from an external source and stores it in the web server’s webroot directory. As I mentioned earlier, two containers can share files by sharing a volume. The webroot directory would be located on this volume.\nFigure 5.7 A sidecar container that delivers content to the web server container via a volume\n\nNOTE\nYou’ll create this pod in the chapter 7.\n\nOther examples of sidecar containers are log rotators and collectors, data processors, communication adapters, and others.\nUnlike changing the application’s existing code, adding a sidecar increases the pod’s resources requirements because an additional process must run in the pod. But keep in mind that adding code to legacy applications can be very difficult. This could be because its code is difficult to modify, it’s difficult to set up the build environment, or the source code itself is no longer available. Extending the application by adding an additional process is sometimes a cheaper and faster option.\nHow to decide whether to split containers into multiple pods\nWhen deciding whether to use the sidecar pattern and place containers in a single pod, or to place them in separate pods, ask yourself the following questions:\n\nDo these containers have to run on the same host?\nDo I want to manage them as a single unit?\nDo they form a unified whole instead of being independent components?\nDo they have to be scaled together?\nCan a single node meet their combined resource needs?\n\nIf the answer to all these questions is yes, put them all in the same pod. As a rule of thumb, always place containers in separate pods unless a specific reason requires them to be part of the same pod.\n"},"docs/Creating_pods_from_YAML_or_JSON_files.html":{"url":"docs/Creating_pods_from_YAML_or_JSON_files.html","title":"5.2 Creating pods from YAML or JSON files","keywords":"","body":"5.2 Creating pods from YAML or JSON files\nWith the information you learned in the previous sections, you can now start creating pods. In chapter 3, you created them using the imperative command kubectl create, but pods and other Kubernetes objects are usually created by creating a JSON or YAML manifest file and posting it to the Kubernetes API, as you’ve already learned in the previous chapter.\nNOTE\nThe decision whether to use YAML or JSON to define your objects is yours. Most people prefer to use YAML because it’s slightly more human-friendly and allows you to add comments to the object definition.\n\nBy using YAML files to define the structure of your application, you don’t need shell scripts to make the process of deploying your applications repeatable, and you can keep a history of all changes by storing these files in a VCS (Version Control System). Just like you store code.\nIn fact, the application manifests of the exercises in this book are all stored in a VCS. You can find them on GitHub at github.com/luksa/kubernetes-in-action-2ed.\nCreating a YAML manifest for a pod\nIn the previous chapter you learned how to retrieve and examine the YAML manifests of existing API objects. Now you’ll create an object manifest from scratch.\nYou’ll start by creating a file called kubia.yaml on your computer, in a file directory of your choice. You can also find the file in the book’s code archive, available on GitHub. The file is in the Chapter04/ directory. The following listing shows its contents.\nListing 5.1 A basic pod manifest: kubia.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:    \n  name: kubia\nspec:    \n  containers:     \n  - name: kubia\n    image: luksa/kubia:1.0\n    ports:        \n    - containerPort: 8080\n\nI’m sure you’ll agree that this pod manifest is much easier to understand than the mammoth of a manifest representing the Node object, which you saw in the previous chapter. But once you post this pod object manifest to the API and then read it back, it won’t be much different.\nThe manifest in listing 5.1 is short only because it does not yet contain all the fields that a pod object gets after it is created through the API. For example, you’ll notice that the metadata section contains only a single field and that the status section is completely missing. Once you create the object from this manifest, this will no longer be the case. But we’ll get to that later.\nBefore you create the object, let’s examine the manifest in detail. It uses version v1 of the Kubernetes API to describe the object. The object is a Pod called kubia. The pod consists of a single container called kubia, based on the luksa/kubia:1.0 image. The pod definition also specifies that the application in the container listens on port 8080.\nTIP\nWhenever you want to create a pod manifest from scratch, you can also use the following command to create the file and then edit it to add more fields: kubectl run kubia --image=luksa/kubia:1.0 --dry-run=client -o yaml > mypod.yaml. The --dry-run=client flag tells kubectl to output the definition instead of actually creating the object via the API.\n\nThe fields in the YAML file are self-explanatory, but if you want more information about each field or want to know what additional fields you can add, remember to use the kubectl explain pods command.\nCreating the Pod object from the YAML file\nAfter you’ve prepared the manifest file for your pod, you can now create the object by posting the file to the Kubernetes API.\nCreating objects by applying the manifest file to the cluster\nWhen you post the manifest to the API, you are directing Kubernetes to apply the manifest to the cluster. That’s why the kubectl sub-command that does this is called apply. Let’s use it to create the pod:\n$ kubectl apply -f kubia.yaml\npod “kubia” created\n\nUpdating objects by modifying the manifest file and re-applying it\nThe kubectl apply command is used for creating objects as well as for making changes to existing objects. If you later decide to make changes to your pod object, you can simply edit the kubia.yaml file and run the apply command again. Some of the pod’s fields aren’t mutable, so the update may fail, but you can always delete the pod and then create it again. You’ll learn how to delete pods and other objects at the end of this chapter.\nRetrieving the full manifest of a running pod\nThe pod object is now part of the cluster configuration. You can now read it back from the API to see the full object manifest with the following command:\n$ kubectl get po kubia -o yaml\n\nIf you run this command, you’ll notice that the manifest has grown considerably compared to the one in the kubia.yaml file. You’ll see that the metadata section is now much bigger, and the object now has a status section. The spec section has also grown by several fields. You can use kubectl explain to learn more about these new fields, but most of them will be explained in this and the following chapters.\nChecking the newly created pod\nLet’s use the basic kubectl commands to see how the pod is doing before we start interacting with the application running inside it.\nQuickly checking the status of a pod\nYour Pod object has been created, but how do you know if the container in the pod is actually running? You can use the kubectl get command to see a summary of the pod:\n$ kubectl get pod kubia\nNAME     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nkubia    1/1     Running   0          32s\n\nYou can see that the pod is running, but not much else. To see more, you can try the kubectl get pod -o wide or the kubectl describe command that you learned in the previous chapter.\nUsing kubectl describe to see pod details\nTo display a more detailed view of the pod, use the kubectl describe command:\nListing 5.2 Using kubectl describe pod to inspect a pod\n$ kubectl describe pod kubia\nName:         kubia\nNamespace:    default\nPriority:     0\nNode:         worker2/172.18.0.4\nStart Time:   Mon, 27 Jan 2020 12:53:28 +0100\n...\n\nThe listing doesn’t show the entire output, but if you run the command yourself, you’ll see virtually all information that you’d see if you print the complete object manifest using the kubectl get -o yaml command.\nInspecting events to see what happens beneath the surface\nAs in the previous chapter where you used the describe node command to inspect a Node object, the describe pod command should display several events related to the pod at the bottom of the output.\nIf you remember, these events aren’t part of the object itself, but are separate objects. Let’s print them to learn more about what happens when you create the pod object. The following listing shows all the events that were logged after creating the pod.\nListing 5.3 Events recorded after deploying a Pod object\n$ kubectl get events\nLAST SEEN   TYPE     REASON      OBJECT      MESSAGE\n   Normal   Scheduled   pod/kubia   Successfully assigned default/\n                                             kubia to worker2\n5m          Normal   Pulling     pod/kubia   Pulling image luksa/kubia:1.0\n5m          Normal   Pulled      pod/kubia   Successfully pulled image\n5m          Normal   Created     pod/kubia   Created container kubia\n5m          Normal   Started     pod/kubia   Started container kubia\n\nThese events are printed in chronological order. The most recent event is at the bottom. You see that the pod was first assigned to one of the worker nodes, then the container image was pulled, then the container was created and finally started.\nNo warning events are displayed, so everything seems to be fine. If this is not the case in your cluster, you should read section 5.4 to learn how to troubleshoot pod failures.\n"},"docs/Interacting_with_the_application_and_the_pod.html":{"url":"docs/Interacting_with_the_application_and_the_pod.html","title":"5.3 Interacting with the application and the pod","keywords":"","body":"5.3 Interacting with the application and the pod\nYour container is now running. In this section, you’ll learn how to communicate with the application, inspect its logs, and execute commands in the container to explore the application’s environment. Let’s confirm that the application running in the container responds to your requests.\nSending requests to the application in the pod\nIn chapter 2, you used the kubectl expose command to create a service that provisioned a load balancer so you could talk to the application running in your pod(s). You’ll now take a different approach. For development, testing and debugging purposes, you may want to communicate directly with a specific pod, rather than using a service that forwards connections to randomly selected pods.\nYou’ve learned that each pod is assigned its own IP address where it can be accessed by every other pod in the cluster. This IP address is typically internal to the cluster. You can’t access it from your local computer, except when Kubernetes is deployed in a specific way – for example, when using kind or Minikube without a VM to create the cluster.\nIn general, to access pods, you must use one of the methods described in the following sections. First, let’s determine the pod’s IP address.\nGetting the pod’s IP address\nYou can get the pod’s IP address by retrieving the pod’s full YAML and searching for the podIP field in the status section. Alternatively, you can display the IP with kubectl describe, but the easiest way is to use kubectl get with the wide output option:\n$ kubectl get pod kubia -o wide\nNAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP           NODE     ...\nkubia   1/1     Running   0          35m   10.244.2.4   worker2  ...\n\nAs indicated in the IP column, my pod’s IP is 10.244.2.4. Now I need to determine the port number the application is listening on.\nGetting the port the application is bound to\nIf I wasn’t the author of the application, it would be difficult for me to find out which port the application listens on. I could inspect its source code or the Dockerfile of the container image, as the port is usually specified there, but I might not have access to either. If someone else had created the pod, how would I know which port it was listening on?\nFortunately, you can specify a list of ports in the pod definition itself. It isn’t necessary to specify any ports, but it is a good idea to always do so. See sidebar for details.\nWhy specify container ports in pod definitions\nSpecifying ports in the pod definition is purely informative. Their omission has no effect on whether clients can connect to the pod’s port. If the container accepts connections through a port bound to its IP address, anyone can connect to it, even if the port isn’t explicitly specified in the pod spec or if you specify an incorrect port number.\nDespite this, it’s a good idea to always specify the ports so that anyone who has access to your cluster can see which ports each pod exposes. By explicitly defining ports, you can also assign a name to each port, which is very useful when you expose pods via services.\nThe pod manifest says that the container uses port 8080, so you now have everything you need to talk to the application.\nConnecting to the pod from the worker nodes\nThe Kubernetes network model dictates that each pod is accessible from any other pod and that each node can reach any pod on any node in the cluster.\nBecause of this, one way to communicate with your pod is to log into one of your worker nodes and talk to the pod from there. You’ve already learned that the way you log on to a node depends on what you used to deploy your cluster. In Minikube, you can run minikube ssh to log in to your single node. On GKE use the gcloud compute ssh command. For other clusters refer to their documentation.\nOnce you have logged into the node, use the curl command with the pod’s IP and port to access your application. My pod’s IP is 10.244.2.4 and the port is 8080, so I run the following command:\n$ curl 10.244.2.4:8080\nHey there, this is kubia. Your IP is ::ffff:10.244.2.1.\n\nNormally you don’t use this method to talk to your pods, but you may need to use it if there are communication issues and you want to find the cause by first trying the shortest possible communication route. In this case, it’s best to log into the node where the pod is located and run curl from there. The communication between it and the pod takes place locally, so this method always has the highest chances of success.\nConnecting from a one-off client pod\nThe second way to test the connectivity of your application is to run curl in another pod that you create specifically for this task. Use this method to test if other pods will be able to access your pod. Even if the network works perfectly, this may not be the case. In chapter 24, you’ll learn how to lock down the network by isolating pods from each other. In such a system, a pod can only talk to the pods it’s allowed to.\nTo run curl in a one-off pod, use the following command:\n$ kubectl run --image=tutum/curl -it --restart=Never --rm client-pod curl 10.244.2.4:8080\nHey there, this is kubia. Your IP is ::ffff:10.244.2.5.\npod \"client-pod\" deleted\n\nThis command runs a pod with a single container created from the tutum/curl image. You can also use any other image that provides the curl binary executable. The -it option attaches your console to the container’s standard input and output, the --restart=Never option ensures that the pod is considered Completed when the curl command and its container terminate, and the --rm options removes the pod at the end. The name of the pod is client-pod and the command executed in its container is curl 10.244.2.4:8080.\nNOTE\nYou can also modify the command to run the bash shell in the client pod and then run curl from the shell.\n\nCreating a pod just to see if it can access another pod is useful when you’re specifically testing pod-to-pod connectivity. If you only want to know if your pod is responding to requests, you can also use the method explained in the next section.\nConnecting to pods via kubectl port forwarding\nDuring development, the easiest way to talk to applications running in your pods is to use the kubectl port-forward command, which allows you to communicate with a specific pod through a proxy bound to a network port on your local computer, as shown in the next figure.\nFigure 5.8 Connecting to a pod through the kubectl port-forward proxy\n\nTo open a communication path with a pod, you don’t even need to look up the pod’s IP, as you only need to specify its name and the port. The following command starts a proxy that forwards your computer’s local port 8080 to the kubia pod’s port 8080:\n$ kubectl port-forward kubia 8080\n... Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080\n... Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 8080\n\nThe proxy now waits for incoming connections. Run the following curl command in another terminal:\n$ curl localhost:8080\nHey there, this is kubia. Your IP is ::ffff:127.0.0.1.\n\nAs you can see, curl has connected to the local proxy and received the response from the pod. While the port-forward command is the easiest method for communicating with a specific pod during development and troubleshooting, it’s also the most complex method in terms of what happens underneath. Communication passes through several components, so if anything is broken in the communication path, you won’t be able to talk to the pod, even if the pod itself is accessible via regular communication channels.\nNOTE\nThe kubectl port-forward command can also forward connections to services instead of pods and has several other useful features. Run kubectl port-forward --help to learn more.\n\nFigure 5.9 shows how the network packets flow from the curl process to your application and back.\nFigure 5.9 The long communication path between curl and the container when using port forwarding\n\nAs shown in the figure, the curl process connects to the proxy, which connects to the API server, which then connects to the Kubelet on the node that hosts the pod, and the Kubelet then connects to the container through the pod’s loopback device (in other words, through the localhost address). I’m sure you’ll agree that the communication path is exceptionally long.\nNOTE\nThe application in the container must be bound to a port on the loopback device for the Kubelet to reach it. If it listens only on the pod’s eth0 network interface, you won’t be able to reach it with the kubectl port-forward command.\n\nViewing application logs\nYour Node.js application writes its log to the standard output stream. Instead of writing the log to a file, containerized applications usually log to the standard output (stdout) and standard error streams (stderr). This allows the container runtime to intercept the output, store it in a consistent location (usually /var/log/containers) and provide access to the log without having to know where each application stores its log files.\nWhen you run an application in a container using Docker, you can display its log with docker logs . When you run your application in Kubernetes, you could log into the node that hosts the pod and display its log using docker logs, but Kubernetes provides an easier way to do this with the kubectl logs command.\nRetrieving a pod’s log with kubectl logs\nTo view the log of your pod (more specifically, the container’s log), run the command shown in the following listing on your local computer:\nListing 5.4 Displaying a pod’s log\n$ kubectl logs kubia\nKubia server starting...\nLocal hostname is kubia\nListening on port 8080\nReceived request for / from ::ffff:10.244.2.1\nReceived request for / from ::ffff:10.244.2.5\nReceived request for / from ::ffff:127.0.0.1\n\nStreaming logs using kubectl logs -f\nIf you want to stream the application log in real-time to see each request as it comes in, you can run the command with the --follow option (or the shorter version -f):\n$ kubectl logs kubia -f\n\nNow send some additional requests to the application and have a look at the log. Press ctrl-C to stop streaming the log when you’re done.\nDisplaying the timestamp of each logged line\nYou may have noticed that we forgot to include the timestamp in the log statement. Logs without timestamps have limited usability. Fortunately, the container runtime attaches the current timestamp to every line produced by the application. You can display these timestamps by using the --timestamps=true option, as shown in the next listing.\nListing 5.5 Displaying the timestamp of each log line\n$ kubectl logs kubia –-timestamps=true\n2020-02-01T09:44:40.954641934Z Kubia server starting...\n2020-02-01T09:44:40.955123432Z Local hostname is kubia\n2020-02-01T09:44:40.956435431Z Listening on port 8080\n2020-02-01T09:50:04.978043089Z Received request for / from ...\n2020-02-01T09:50:33.640897378Z Received request for / from ...\n2020-02-01T09:50:44.781473256Z Received request for / from ...\n\nTIP\nYou can display timestamps by only typing --timestamps without the value. For boolean options, merely specifying the option name sets the option to true. This applies to all kubectl options that take a Boolean value and default to false.\n\nDisplaying recent logs\nThe previous feature is great if you run third-party applications that don’t include the timestamp in their log output, but the fact that each line is timestamped brings us another benefit: filtering log lines by time. Kubectl provides two ways of filtering the logs by time.\nThe first option is when you want to only display logs from the past several seconds, minutes or hours. For example, to see the logs produced in the last two minutes, run:\n$ kubectl logs kubia --since=2m\n\nThe other option is to display logs produced after a specific date and time using the --since-time option. The time format to be used is RFC3339. For example, the following command is used to print logs produced after February 1st, 2020 at 9:50 a.m.:\n$ kubectl logs kubia –-since-time=2020-02-01T09:50:00Z\n\nDisplaying the last several lines of the log\nInstead of using time to constrain the output, you can also specify how many lines from the end of the log you want to display. To display the last ten lines, try:\n$ kubectl logs kubia –-tail=10\n\nNOTE\nKubectl options that take a value can be specified with an equal sign or with a space. Instead of --tail=10, you can also type --tail 10.\n\nUnderstanding the availability of the pod’s logs\nKubernetes keeps a separate log file for each container. They are usually stored in /var/log/containers on the node that runs the container. A separate file is created for each container. If the container is restarted, its logs are written to a new file. Because of this, if the container is restarted while you’re following its log with kubectl logs -f, the command will terminate, and you’ll need to run it again to stream the new container’s logs.\nThe kubectl logs command displays only the logs of the current container. To view the logs from the previous container, use the --previous (or -p) option.\nNOTE\nDepending on your cluster configuration, the log files may also be rotated when they reach a certain size. In this case, kubectl logs will only display the new log file. When streaming the logs, you must restart the command to switch to the new file.\n\nWhen you delete a pod, all its log files are also deleted. To make pods’ logs available permanently, you need to set up a central, cluster-wide logging system. Chapter 23 explains how.\nWhat about applications that write their logs to files?\nIf your application writes its logs to a file instead of stdout, you may be wondering how to access that file. Ideally, you’d configure the centralized logging system to collect the logs so you can view them in a central location, but sometimes you just want to keep things simple and don’t mind accessing the logs manually. In the next two sections, you’ll learn how to copy log and other files from the container to your computer and in the opposite direction, and how to run commands in running containers. You can use either method to display the log files or any other file inside the container.\nCopying files to and from containers\nSometimes you may want to add a file to a running container or retrieve a file from it. Modifying files in running containers isn’t something you normally do - at least not in production - but it can be useful during development.\nKubectl offers the cp command to copy files or directories from your local computer to a container of any pod or from the container to your computer. For example, to copy the /etc/hosts file from the container of the kubia pod to the /tmp directory on your local file system, run the following command:\n$ kubectl cp kubia:/etc/hosts /tmp/kubia-hosts\n\nTo copy a file from your local file system to the container, run the following command:\n$ kubectl cp /path/to/local/file kubia:path/in/container\n\nNOTE\nThe kubectl cp command requires the tar binary to be present in your container, but this requirement may change in the future.\n\nExecuting commands in running containers\nWhen debugging an application running in a container, it may be necessary to examine the container and its environment from the inside. Kubectl provides this functionality, too. You can execute any binary file present in the container’s file system using the kubectl exec command.\nInvoking a single command in the container\nFor example, you can list the processes running in the container in the kubia pod by running the following command:\nListing 5.6 Processes running inside a pod container\n$ kubectl exec kubia -- ps aux\nUSER  PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND\nroot    1  0.0  1.3 812860 27356 ?   Ssl  11:54 0:00 node app.js\nroot  120  0.0  0.1  17500  2128 ?   Rs   12:22 0:00 ps aux\n\nThis is the Kubernetes equivalent of the Docker command you used to explore the processes in a running container in chapter 2. It allows you to remotely run a command in any pod without having to log in to the node that hosts the pod. If you’ve used ssh to execute commands on a remote system, you’ll see that kubectl exec is not much different.\nIn section 5.3.1 you executed the curl command in a one-off client pod to send a request to your application, but you can also run the command inside the kubia pod itself:\n$ kubectl exec kubia -- curl -s localhost:8080\nHey there, this is kubia. Your IP is ::1.\n\nWhy use a double dash in the kubectl exec command?\nThe double dash (--) in the command delimits kubectl arguments from the command to be executed in the container. The use of the double dash isn’t necessary if the command has no arguments that begin with a dash. If you omit the double dash in the previous example, the -s option is interpreted as an option for kubectl exec and results in the following misleading error:\n$ kubectl exec kubia curl -s localhost:8080\n\nThe connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused – did you specify the right host or port?\nThis may look like the Node.js server is refusing to accept the connection, but the issue lies elsewhere. The curl command is never executed. The error is reported by kubectl itself when it tries to talk to the Kubernetes API server at localhost:8080, which isn’t where the server is. If you run the kubectl options command, you’ll see that the -s option can be used to specify the address and port of the Kubernetes API server. Instead of passing that option to curl, kubectl adopted it as its own. Adding the double dash prevents this.\nFortunately, to prevent scenarios like this, newer versions of kubectl are set to return an error if you forget the double dash.\nRunning an interactive shell in the container\nThe two previous examples showed how a single command can be executed in the container. When the command completes, you are returned to your shell. If you want to run several commands in the container, you can run a shell in the container as follows:\n$ kubectl exec -it kubia -- bash\nroot@kubia:/#\n\nThe -it is short for two options: -i and -t, which indicate that you want to execute the bash command interactively by passing the standard input to the container and marking it as a terminal (TTY).\nYou can now explore the inside of the container by executing commands in the shell. For example, you can view the files in the container by running ls -la, view its network interfaces with ip link, or test its connectivity with ping. You can run any tool available in the container.\nNot all containers allow you to run shells\nThe container image of your application contains many important debugging tools, but this isn’t the case with every container image. To keep images small and improve security in the container, most containers used in production don’t contain any binary files other than those required for the container’s primary process. This significantly reduces the attack surface, but also means that you can’t run shells or other tools in production containers. Fortunately, a new Kubernetes feature called ephemeral containers allows you to debug running containers by attaching a debug container to them.\nNOTE TO MEAP READERS\nEphemeral containers are currently an alpha feature, which means they may change or even be removed at any time. This is also why they are currently not explained in this book. If they graduate to beta before the book goes into production, a section explaining them will be added.\n\nAttaching to a running container\nThe kubectl attach command is another way to interact with a running container. It attaches itself to the standard input, output and error streams of the main process running in the container. Normally, you only use it to interact with applications that read from the standard input.\nUsing kubectl attach to see what the application prints to standard output\nIf the application doesn’t read from standard input, the kubectl attach command is only an alternative way to stream the application logs, as these are typically written to the standard output and error streams, and the attach command streams them just like the kubectl logs -f command does.\nAttach to your kubia pod by running the following command:\n$ kubectl attach kubia\nDefaulting container name to kubia.\nUse 'kubectl describe pod/kubia -n default' to see all of the containers in this pod.\nIf you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.\n\nNow, when you send new HTTP requests to the application using curl in another terminal, you’ll see the lines that the application logs to standard output also printed in the terminal where the kubectl attach command is executed.\nUsing kubectl attach to write to the application’s standard input\nThe kubia application doesn’t read from the standard input stream, but you’ll find another version of the application that does this in the book’s code archive. You can change the greeting with which the application responds to HTTP requests by writing it to the standard input stream of the application. Let’s deploy this version of the application in a new pod and use the kubectl attach command to change the greeting.\nYou can find the artifacts required to build the image in the kubia-stdin-image/ directory, or you can use the pre-built image docker.io/luksa/kubia:1.0-stdin. The pod manifest is in the file kubia-stdin.yaml. It is only slightly different from the pod manifest in kubia.yaml that you deployed previously. The differences are highlighted in the following listing.\nListing 5.7 Enabling standard input for a container\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: kubia-stdin\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: kubia\n    image: luksa/kubia:1.0-stdin\n    stdin: true\n    ports:\n    - containerPort: 8080\n\nAs you can see in the listing, if the application running in a pod wants to read from standard input, you must indicate this in the pod manifest by setting the stdin field in the container definition to true. This tells Kubernetes to allocate a buffer for the standard input stream, otherwise the application will always receive an EOF when it tries to read from it.\nCreate the pod from this manifest file with the kubectl apply command:\n$ kubectl apply -f kubia-stdin.yaml\npod/kubia-stdin created\n\nTo enable communication with the application, use the kubectl port-forward command again, but because the local port 8080 is still being used by the previously executed port-forward command, you must either terminate it or choose a different local port to forward to the new pod. You can do this as follows:\n$ kubectl port-forward kubia-stdin 8888:8080\nForwarding from 127.0.0.1:8888 -> 8080\nForwarding from [::1]:8888 -> 8080\n\nThe command-line argument 8888:8080 instructs the command to forward local port 8888 to the pod’s port 8080.\nYou can now reach the application at http://localhost:8888:\n$ curl localhost:8888\nHey there, this is kubia-stdin. Your IP is ::ffff:127.0.0.1.\n\nLet’s change the greeting from “Hey there” to “Howdy” by using kubectl attach to write to the standard input stream of the application. Run the following command:\n$ kubectl attach -i kubia-stdin\n\nNote the use of the additional option -i in the command. It instructs kubectl to pass its standard input to the container.\nNOTE\nLike the kubectl exec command, kubectl attach also supports the --tty or -t option, which indicates that the standard input is a terminal (TTY), but the container must be configured to allocate a terminal through the tty field in the container definition.\n\nYou can now enter the new greeting into the terminal and press the ENTER key. The application should then respond with the new greeting:\nHowdy\nGreeting set to: Howdy\n\nTo see if the application now responds to HTTP requests with the new greeting, re-execute the curl command or refresh the page in your web browser:\n$ curl localhost:8888\nHowdy, this is kubia-stdin. Your IP is ::ffff:127.0.0.1.\n\nThere’s the new greeting. You can change it again by typing another line in the terminal with the kubectl attach command. To exit the attach command, press Control-C or the equivalent key.\nNOTE\nAn additional field in the container definition, stdinOnce, determines whether the standard input channel is closed when the attach session ends. It’s set to false by default, which allows you to use the standard input in every kubectl attach session. If you set it to true, standard input remains open only during the first session.\n\n"},"docs/Running_multiple_containers_in_a_pod.html":{"url":"docs/Running_multiple_containers_in_a_pod.html","title":"5.4 Running multiple containers in a pod","keywords":"","body":"5.4 Running multiple containers in a pod\nThe kubia application you deployed in section 5.2 only supports HTTP. Let's add TLS support so it can also serve clients over HTTPS. You could do this by writing additional code, but an easier option exists where you don’t need to touch the code at all.\nYou can run a reverse proxy alongside the Node.js application in a sidecar container, as explained in section 5.1.2, and let it handle HTTPS requests on behalf of the application. A very popular software package that can provide this functionality is Envoy. The Envoy proxy is a high-performance open source service proxy originally built by Lyft that has since been contributed to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Let’s add it to your pod.\nExtending the kubia Node.js application using the Envoy proxy\nLet me briefly explain what the new architecture of the application will look like. As shown in the next figure, the pod will have two containers - the Node.js and the new Envoy container. The Node.js container will continue to handle HTTP requests directly, but the HTTPS requests will be handled by Envoy. For each incoming HTTPS request, Envoy will create a new HTTP request that it will then send to the Node.js application via the local loopback device (via the localhost IP address).\nFigure 5.10 Detailed view of the pod’s containers and network interfaces\n\nEnvoy also provides a web-based administration interface that will prove handy in some of the exercises in the next chapter.\nIt’s obvious that if you implement TLS support within the Node.js application itself, the application will consume less computing resources and have lower latency because no additional network hop is required, but adding the Envoy proxy could be a faster and easier solution. It also provides a good starting point from which you can add many other features provided by Envoy that you would probably never implement in the application code itself. Refer to the Envoy proxy documentation at envoyproxy.io to learn more.\nAdding Envoy proxy to the pod\nYou’ll create a new pod with two containers. You’ve already got the Node.js container, but you also need a container that will run Envoy.\nCreating the Envoy container image\nThe authors of the proxy have published the official Envoy proxy container image at Docker Hub. You could use this image directly, but you would need to somehow provide the configuration, certificate, and private key files to the Envoy process in the container. You’ll learn how to do this in chapter 7. For now, you’ll use an image that already contains all three files.\nI’ve already created the image and made it available at docker.io/luksa/kubia-ssl-proxy:1.0, but if you want to build it yourself, you can find the files in the kubia-ssl-proxy-image directory in the book's code archive.\nThe directory contains the Dockerfile, as well as the private key and certificate that the proxy will use to serve HTTPS. It also contains the envoy.conf config file. In it, you’ll see that the proxy is configured to listen on port 8443, terminate TLS, and forward requests to port 8080 on localhost, which is where the Node.js application is listening. The proxy is also configured to provide an administration interface on port 9901, as explained earlier.\nCreating the pod manifest\nAfter building the image, you must create the manifest for the new pod, as shown in the following listing.\nListing 5.8 Manifest of pod kubia-ssl (kubia-ssl.yaml)\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: kubia-ssl                                \nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: kubia\n    image: luksa/kubia:1.0\n    ports:\n    - name: http                #B\n      containerPort: 8080       #B\n  - name: envoy\n    image: luksa/kubia-ssl-proxy:1.0\n    ports:\n    - name: https               #D\n      containerPort: 8443       #D\n    - name: admin               #E\n      containerPort: 9901       #E\n\nThe name of this pod is kubia-ssl. It has two containers: kubia and envoy. The manifest is only slightly more complex than the manifest in section 5.2.1. The only new fields are the port names, which are included so that anyone reading the manifest can understand what each port number stands for.\nCreating the pod\nCreate the pod from the manifest using the command kubectl apply -f kubia-ssl.yaml. Then use the kubectl get and kubectl describe commands to confirm that the pod’s containers were successfully launched.\nInteracting with the two-container pod\nWhen the pod starts, you can start using the application in the pod, inspect its logs and explore the containers from within.\nCommunicating with the application\nAs before, you can use the kubectl port-forward to enable communication with the application in the pod. Because it exposes three different ports, you enable forwarding to all three ports as follows:\n$ kubectl port-forward kubia-ssl 8080 8443 9901\nForwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080\nForwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 8080\nForwarding from 127.0.0.1:8443 -> 8443\nForwarding from [::1]:8443 -> 8443\nForwarding from 127.0.0.1:9901 -> 9901\nForwarding from [::1]:9901 -> 9901\n\nFirst, confirm that you can communicate with the application via HTTP by opening the URL http://localhost:8080 in your browser or by using curl:\n$ curl localhost:8080\nHey there, this is kubia-ssl. Your IP is ::ffff:127.0.0.1.\n\nIf this works, you can also try to access the application over HTTPS at https://localhost:8443. With curl you can do this as follows:\n$ curl https://localhost:8443 --insecure\nHey there, this is kubia-ssl. Your IP is ::ffff:127.0.0.1.\n\nSuccess! The Envoy proxy handles the task perfectly. Your application now supports HTTPS using a sidecar container.\nWhy it is necessary to use the --insecure option\nThere are two reasons why you must use the --insecure option when accessing the service. The certificate used by the Envoy proxy is self-signed and was issued for the domain name example.com.  You access the service via the local kubectl proxy and use localhost as the domain name in the URL, which means that it doesn’t match the name in the server certificate. To make it match, you’d have to use the following command:\n$ curl https://example.com:8443 --resolve example.com:8443:127.0.0.1\n\nThis ensures that the certificate matches the requested URL, but because the certificate is self-signed, curl still can’t verify the legitimacy of the server. You must either replace the server’s certificate with a certificate signed by a trusted authority or use the --insecure flag anyway; in this case, you also don’t need to bother with using the --resolve flag.\nDisplaying logs of pods with multiple containers\nThe kubia-ssl pod contains two containers, so if you want to display the logs, you must specify the name of the container using the --container or -c option. For example, to view the logs of the kubia container, run the following command:\n$ kubectl logs kubia-ssl -c kubia\n\nThe Envoy proxy runs in the container named envoy, so you display its logs as follows:\n$ kubectl logs kubia-ssl -c envoy\n\nAlternatively, you can display the logs of both containers with the --all-containers option:\n$ kubectl logs kubia-ssl --all-containers\n\nYou can also combine these commands with the other options explained in section 5.3.2.\nRunning commands in containers of multi-container pods\nIf you’d like to run a shell or another command in one of the pod’s containers using the kubectl exec command, you also specify the container name using the --container or -c option. For example, to run a shell inside the envoy container, run the following command:\n$ kubectl exec -it kubia-ssl -c envoy -- bash\n\nNOTE\nIf you don’t provide the name, kubectl exec defaults to the first container specified in the pod manifest.\n\n"},"docs/Running_additional_containers_at_pod_startup.html":{"url":"docs/Running_additional_containers_at_pod_startup.html","title":"5.5 Running additional containers at pod startup","keywords":"","body":"5.5 Running additional containers at pod startup\nWhen a pod contains more than one container, all the containers are started in parallel. Kubernetes doesn’t yet provide a mechanism to specify whether a container depends on another container, which would allow you to ensure that one is started before the other. However, Kubernetes allows you to run a sequence of containers to initialize the pod before its main containers start. This special type of container is explained in this section.\nIntroducing init containers\nA pod manifest can specify a list of containers to run when the pod starts and before the pod’s normal containers are started. These containers are intended to initialize the pod and are appropriately called init containers. As the following figure shows, they run one after the other and must all finish successfully before the main containers of the pod are started.\nFigure 5.11 Time sequence showing how a pod’s init and regular containers are started\n\nInit containers are like the pod’s regular containers, but they don’t run in parallel - only one init container runs at a time.\nUnderstanding what init containers can do\nInit containers are typically added to pods to achieve the following:\n\nInitialize files in the volumes used by the pod’s main containers. This includes retrieving certificates and private keys used by the main container from secure certificate stores, generating config files, downloading data, and so on.\nInitialize the pod’s networking system. Because all containers of the pod share the same network namespaces, and thus the network interfaces and configuration, any changes made to it by an init container also affect the main container.\nDelay the start of the pod’s main containers until a precondition is met. For example, if the main container relies on another service being available before the container is started, an init container can block until this service is ready.\nNotify an external service that the pod is about to start running. In special cases where an external system must be notified when a new instance of the application is started, an init container can be used to deliver this notification.\n\nYou could perform these operations in the main container itself but using an init container is sometimes a better option and can have other advantages. Let’s see why.\nUnderstanding when moving initialization code to init containers makes sense\nUsing an init container to perform initialization tasks doesn’t require the main container image to be rebuilt and allows a single init container image to be reused with many different applications. This is especially useful if you want to inject the same infrastructure-specific initialization code into all your pods. Using an init container also ensures that this initialization is complete before any of the (possibly multiple) main containers start.\nAnother important reason is security. By moving tools or data that could be used by an attacker to compromise your cluster from the main container to an init container, you reduce the pod’s attack surface.\nFor example, imagine that the pod must be registered with an external system. The pod needs some sort of secret token to authenticate against this system. If the registration procedure is performed by the main container, this secret token must be present in its filesystem. If the application running in the main container has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the filesystem, the attacker may be able to obtain this token. By performing the registration from an init container, the token must be available only in the filesystem of the init container, which an attacker can’t easily compromise.\nAdding init containers to a pod\nIn a pod manifest, init containers are defined in the initContainers field in the spec section, just as regular containers are defined in its containers field.\nAdding two containers to the kubia-ssl pod\nLet’s look at an example of adding two init containers to the kubia pod. The first init container emulates an initialization procedure. It runs for 5 seconds, while printing a few lines of text to standard output.\nThe second init container performs a network connectivity test by using the ping command to check if a specific IP address is reachable from within the pod. If the IP address is not specified, the address 1.1.1.1 is used. You’ll find the Dockerfiles and other artifacts for both images in the book’s code archive, if you want to build them yourself. Alternatively, you can use the pre-build images specified in the following listing.\nA pod manifest containing these two init containers is in the kubia-init.yaml file. The following listing shows how the init containers are defined.\nListing 5.9 Defining init containers in a pod manifest: kubia-init.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: kubia-init\nspec:\n  initContainers:\n  - name: init-demo\n    image: luksa/init-demo:1.0\n  - name: network-check\n    image: luksa/network-connectivity-checker:1.0\n  containers:\n  - name: kubia\n    image: luksa/kubia:1.0\n    ports:\n    - name: http\n      containerPort: 8080\n  - name: envoy\n    image: luksa/kubia-ssl-proxy:1.0\n    ports:\n    - name: https\n      containerPort: 8443\n    - name: admin\n      containerPort: 9901\n\nAs you can see, the definition of an init container is almost trivial. It’s sufficient to specify only the name and image for each container.\nNOTE\nContainer names must be unique within the union of all init and regular containers.\n\nDeploying a pod with init containers\nBefore you create the pod from the manifest file, run the following command in a separate terminal so you can see how the pod’s status changes as the init and regular containers start:\n$ kubectl get pods -w\n\nYou’ll also want to watch events in another terminal using the following command:\n$ kubectl get events -w\n\nWhen ready, create the pod by running the apply command:\n$ kubectl apply -f kubia-init.yaml\n\nInspecting the startup of a pod with init containers\nAs the pod starts up, inspect the events that the kubectl get events -w command prints. The following listing shows what you should see.\nListing 5.10 Pod events showing how the execution of init containers\nTYPE     REASON      MESSAGE\nNormal   Scheduled   Successfully assigned pod to worker2\nNormal   Pulling     Pulling image \"luksa/init-demo:1.0\"\nNormal   Pulled      Successfully pulled image\nNormal   Created     Created container init-demo\nNormal   Started     Started container init-demo\nNormal   Pulling     Pulling image \"luksa/network-connec...\nNormal   Pulled      Successfully pulled image\nNormal   Created     Created container network-check\nNormal   Started     Started container network-check\nNormal   Pulled      Container image \"luksa/kubia:1.0\"\n                     already present on machine\nNormal   Created     Created container kubia\nNormal   Started     Started container kubia\nNormal   Pulled      Container image \"luksa/kubia-ssl-\n                     proxy:1.0\" already present on machine\nNormal   Created     Created container envoy\nNormal   Started     Started container envoy\n\nThe listing shows the order in which the containers are started. The init-demo container is started first. When it completes, the network-check container is started, and when it completes, the two main containers, kubia and envoy, are started.\nNow inspect the transitions of the pod’s status in the other terminal. They are shown in the next listing.\nListing 5.11 Pod status changes during startup involving init containers\nNAME         READY   STATUS            RESTARTS   AGE\nkubia-init   0/2     Pending           0          0s\nkubia-init   0/2     Pending           0          0s\nkubia-init   0/2     Init:0/2          0          0s\nkubia-init   0/2     Init:0/2          0          1s\nkubia-init   0/2     Init:1/2          0          6s\nkubia-init   0/2     PodInitializing   0          7s\nkubia-init   2/2     Running           0          8s\n\nAs the listing shows, when the init containers run, the pod’s status shows the number of init containers that have completed and the total number. When all init containers are done, the pod’s status is displayed as PodInitializing. At this point, the images of the main containers are pulled. When the containers start, the status changes to Running.\nInspecting init containers\nWhile the init containers run and after they have finished, you can display their logs and enter the running container, just as you can with regular containers.\nDisplaying the logs of an init container\nThe standard and error output, into which each init container can write, are captured exactly as they are for regular containers. The logs of an init container can be displayed using the kubectl logs command by specifying the name of the container with the -c option. To display the logs of the network-check container in the kubia-init pod, run the command shown in the following listing.\nListing 5.12 Displaying the logs of an init container\n$ kubectl logs kubia-init -c network-check\nChecking network connectivity to 1.1.1.1 ...\nHost appears to be reachable\n\nThe logs show that the network-check init container ran without errors. In the next chapter, you’ll see what happens if an init container fails.\nEntering a running init container\nYou can use the kubectl exec command to run a shell or a different command inside an init container the same way you can with regular containers, but you can only do this before the init container terminates. If you’d like to try this yourself, create a pod from the kubia-init-slow.yaml file, which makes the init-demo container run for 60 seconds. When the pod starts, run a shell in the container with the following command:\n$ kubectl exec -it kubia-init-slow -c init-demo -- sh\n\nYou can use the shell to explore the container from the inside, but not for long. When the container’s main process exits after 60 seconds, the shell process is also terminated.\nYou typically enter a running init container only when it fails to complete in time, and you want to find the cause. During normal operation, the init container terminates before you can run the kubectl exec command.\n"},"docs/Deleting_pods_and_other_objects.html":{"url":"docs/Deleting_pods_and_other_objects.html","title":"5.6 Deleting pods and other objects","keywords":"","body":"5.6 Deleting pods and other objects\nIf you’ve tried the exercises in this chapter and in chapter 2, several pods and other objects now exist in your cluster. To close this chapter, you’ll learn various ways to delete them. Deleting a pod will terminate its containers and remove them from the node. Deleting a Deployment object causes the deletion of its pods, whereas deleting a LoadBalancer-typed Service deprovisions the load balancer if one was provisioned.\nDeleting a pod by name\nThe easiest way to delete an object is to delete it by name.\nDeleting a single pod\nUse the following command to remove the kubia pod from your cluster:\n$ kubectl delete po kubia\npod \"kubia\" deleted\n\nBy deleting a pod, you state that you no longer want the pod or its containers to exist. The Kubelet shuts down the pod’s containers, removes all associated resources, such as log files, and notifies the API server after this process is complete. The Pod object is then removed.\nTIP\nBy default, the kubectl delete command waits until the object no longer exists. To skip the wait, run the command with the --wait=false option.\n\nWhile the pod is in the process of shutting down, its status changes to Terminating:\n$ kubectl get po kubia\nNAME    READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE\nkubia   1/1     Terminating   0          35m\n\nKnowing exactly how containers are shut down is important if you want your application to provide a good experience for its clients. This is explained in the next chapter, where we dive deeper into the life cycle of the pod and its containers.\nNOTE\nIf you’re familiar with Docker, you may wonder if you can stop a pod and start it again later, as you can with Docker containers. The answer is no. With Kubernetes, you can only remove a pod completely and create it again later.\n\nDeleting multiple pods with a single command\nYou can also delete multiple pods with a single command. If you ran the kubia-init and the kubia-init-slow pods, you can delete them both by specifying their names separated by a space, as follows:\n$ kubectl delete po kubia-init kubia-init-slow\npod \"kubia-init\" deleted\npod \"kubia-init-slow\" deleted\n\nDeleting objects defined in manifest files\nWhenever you create objects from a file, you can also delete them by passing the file to the delete command instead of specifying the name of the pod.\nDeleting objects by specifying the manifest file\nYou can delete the kubia-ssl pod, which you created from the kubia-ssl.yaml file, with the following command:\n$ kubectl delete -f kubia-ssl.yaml\npod \"kubia-ssl\" deleted\n\nIn your case, the file contains only a single pod object, but you’ll typically come across files that contain several objects of different types that represent a complete application. This makes deploying and removing the application as easy as executing kubectl apply -f app.yaml and kubectl delete -f app.yaml, respectively.\nDeleting objects from multiple manifest files\nSometimes, an application is defined in several manifest files. You can specify multiple files by separating them with a comma. For example:\n$ kubectl delete -f kubia.yaml,kubia-ssl.yaml\n\nNOTE\nYou can also apply several files at the same time using this syntax (for example: kubectl apply -f kubia.yaml,kubia-ssl.yaml).\n\nI’ve never actually used this approach in the many years I’ve been using Kubernetes, but I often deploy all the manifest files from a file directory by specifying the directory name instead of the names of individual files. For example, you can deploy all the pods you created in this chapter again by running the following command in the base directory of this book’s code archive:\n$ kubectl apply -f Chapter05/\n\nThis applies all files in the directory that have the correct file extension (.yaml, .json, and others). You can then delete the pods using the same method:\n$ kubectl delete -f Chapter05/\n\nNOTE\nUse the --recursive flag to also scan subdirectories.\n\nDeleting all pods\nYou’ve now removed all pods except kubia-stdin and the pods you created in chapter 3 using the kubectl create deployment command. Depending on how you’ve scaled the deployment, some of these pods should still be running:\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nkubia-stdin             1/1     Running   0          10m\nkubia-9d785b578-58vhc   1/1     Running   0          1d\nkubia-9d785b578-jmnj8   1/1     Running   0          1d\n\nInstead of deleting these pods by name, we can delete them all using the --all option:\n$ kubectl delete po --all\npod \"kubia-stdin\" deleted\npod \"kubia-9d785b578-58vhc\" deleted\npod \"kubia-9d785b578-jmnj8\" deleted\n\nNow confirm that no pods exist by executing the kubectl get pods command again:\n$ kubectl get po\nNAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nkubia-9d785b578-cc6tk   1/1     Running   0          13s\nkubia-9d785b578-h4gml   1/1     Running   0          13s\n\nThat was unexpected! Two pods are still running. If you look closely at their names, you’ll see that these aren’t the two you’ve just deleted. The AGE column also indicates that these are new pods. You can try to delete them as well, but you’ll see that no matter how often you delete them, new pods are created to replace them.\nThe reason why these pods keep popping up is because of the Deployment object. The controller responsible for bringing Deployment objects to life must ensure that the number of pods always matches the desired number of replicas specified in the object. When you delete a pod associated with the Deployment, the controller immediately creates a replacement pod.\nTo delete these pods, you must either scale the Deployment to zero or delete the object altogether. This would indicate that you no longer want this deployment or its pods to exist in your cluster.\nDeleting objects of most kinds\nYou can delete everything you’ve created so far - including the deployment, its pods, and the service - with the command shown in the next listing.\nListing 5.13 Deleting most objects regardless of type\n$ kubectl delete all --all\npod \"kubia-9d785b578-cc6tk\" deleted\npod \"kubia-9d785b578-h4gml\" deleted\nservice \"kubernetes\" deleted\nservice \"kubia\" deleted\ndeployment.apps \"kubia\" deleted\nreplicaset.apps \"kubia-9d785b578\" deleted\n\nThe first all in the command indicates that you want to delete objects of all types. The --all option indicates that you want to delete all instances of each object type. You used this option in the previous section when you tried to delete all pods.\nWhen deleting objects, kubectl prints the type and name of each deleted object. In the previous listing, you should see that it deleted the pods, the deployment, and the service, but also a so-called replica set object. You’ll learn what this is in chapter 11, where we take a closer look at deployments.\nYou’ll notice that the delete command also deletes the built-in kubernetes service. Don’t worry about this, as the service is automatically recreated after a few moments.\nCertain objects aren’t deleted when using this method, because the keyword all does not include all object kinds. This is a precaution to prevent you from accidentally deleting objects that contain important information. The Event object kind is one example of this.\nNOTE\nYou can specify multiple object types in the delete command. For example, you can use kubectl delete events,all --all to delete events along with all object kinds included in all.\n\n"},"docs/Summary_5.html":{"url":"docs/Summary_5.html","title":"5.7 Summary","keywords":"","body":"5.7 Summary\nIn this chapter, you’ve learned:\n\nPods run one or more containers as a co-located group.

A frontend and a backend process should run in separate pods. This allows them to be scaled individually.\nWhen a pod starts, its init containers run one after the other. When the last init container completes, the pod’s main containers are started. You can use an init container to configure the pod from within, delay startup of its main containers until a precondition is met, or notify an external service that the pod is about to start running.\nThe kubectl tool is used to create pods, view their logs, copy files to/from their containers, execute commands in those containers and enable communication with individual pods during development.\n\nIn the next chapter, you’ll learn about the lifecycle of the pod and its containers.\n"},"docs/Managing_the_lifecycle_of_the_Pods_containers.html":{"url":"docs/Managing_the_lifecycle_of_the_Pods_containers.html","title":"6.

A pod’s status section contains the following information:\n\nthe IP addresses of the pod and the worker node that hosts it\nwhen the pod was started\nthe pod’s quality-of-service (QoS) class\nwhat phase the pod is in,\nthe conditions of the pod, and\nthe state of its individual containers.\n\nThe IP addresses and the start time don’t need any further explanation, and the QoS class isn’t relevant now - you’ll learn about it in chapter 19.

Possibly the worker node has failed or has disconnected from the network.\n\n\n\nTable 6.1 List of phases a pod can be in\nThe pod’s phase provides a quick summary of what’s happening with the pod. Let’s deploy the kubia pod again and inspect its phase. Create the pod by applying the kubia.yaml manifest to your cluster again, as in the previous chapter:\n$ kubectl apply -f kubia.yaml\n\nDisplaying a pod’s phase\nThe pod’s phase is one of the fields in the pod object’s status section. You can see it by displaying its manifest and optionally grepping the output to search for the field:\n$ kubectl get po kubia -o yaml | grep phase\nphase: Running\n\nTIP\nRemember the jq tool? You can use it instead to print out the value of the phase field like this: kubectl get po kubia -o json | jq .status.phase\n\nYou can also see the pod’s phase using kubectl describe. The pod’s status is shown close to the top of the output.\n$ kubectl describe po kubia\nName:         kubia\nNamespace:    default\n...\nStatus:       Running\n...\n\nAlthough it may appear that the STATUS column displayed by kubectl get pods also shows the phase, this is only true for pods that are healthy:\n$ kubectl get po kubia\nNAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nkubia   1/1     Running   0          40m\n\nFor unhealthy pods, the STATUS column indicates what’s wrong with the pod. You’ll see this later in this chapter.\nUnderstanding pod conditions\nThe phase of a pod says little about the condition of the pod. You can learn more by looking at the pod’s list of conditions, just as you did for the node object in the chapter 4. A pod’s conditions indicate whether a pod has reached a certain state or not, and why that’s the case.\nIn contrast to the phase, a pod has several conditions at the same time. Four condition types are known at the time of writing. They are explained in the following table.\n\n\n\nPod Condition\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPodScheduled\nIndicates whether or not the pod has been scheduled to a node.\n\n\nInitialized\nThe pod’s init containers have all completed successfully.\n\n\nContainersReady\nAll containers in the pod indicate that they are ready. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the entire pod to be ready.\n\n\nReady\nThe pod is ready to provide services to its clients. The containers in the pod and the pod’s readiness gates are all reporting that they are ready. Note: this is explained in chapter 10.\n\n\n\nTable 6.2 List of pod conditions\nEach condition is either fulfilled or not. As you can see in the following figure, the PodScheduled and Initialized conditions start as unfulfilled, but are soon fulfilled and remain so throughout the life of the pod. In contrast, the Ready and ContainersReady conditions can change many times during the pod’s lifetime.\nFigure 6.2 The transitions of the pod’s conditions during its lifecycle\n\nDo you remember the conditions you can find in a node object? They are MemoryPressure, DiskPressure, PIDPressure and Ready. As you can see, each object has its own set of condition types, but many contain the generic Ready condition, which typically indicates whether everything is fine with the object.\nInspecting the pod’s conditions\nTo see the conditions of a pod, you can use kubectl describe as in the next listing:\nListing 6.1 Displaying a pod’s conditions using kubectl describe\n$ kubectl describe po kubia | grep Conditions: -A5\nConditions:\n  Type              Status\n  Initialized       True            #A\n  Ready             True            #B\n  ContainersReady   True            #B\n  PodScheduled      True            #C\n\n#A The pod has been initialized\n#B The pod and its containers are ready\n#C The pod has been scheduled to a node\nThe kubectl describe command only shows whether each condition is true or not. To find out why a condition is false, you must inspect the pod manifest, as shown in the next listing.\nListing 6.2 Displaying a pod’s conditions using kubectl and jq\n$ kubectl get po kubia -o json | jq .status.conditions\n[\n  {\n    \"lastProbeTime\": null,\n    \"lastTransitionTime\": \"2020-02-02T11:42:59Z\",\n    \"status\": \"True\",\n    \"type\": \"Initialized\"\n  },\n  ...\n\nEach condition has a status field that indicates whether the condition is True, False or Unknown. In the case of the kubia pod, the status of all conditions is True, which means they are all fulfilled. The condition can also contain a reason field that specifies a machine-facing reason for the last change of the condition’s status, and a message field that explains the change in detail. The lastTransitionTime field shows when the change occurred, while the lastProbeTime indicates when this condition was last checked.\nUnderstanding the status of the containers\nAlso contained in the status of the pod is the status of each of its containers. Inspecting the status provides better insight into the operation of each individual container.\nThe status contains several fields. The state field indicates the container’s current state, whereas the lastState field shows the state of the previous container after it has terminated. The container status also indicates the internal ID of the container (containerID), the image and imageID the container is running, whether the container is ready or not and how often it has been restarted (restartCount).\nUnderstanding the container state\nThe most important part of a container’s status is its state. A container can be in one of the states shown in the following figure.\nFigure 6.3 The possible states of a container\n\nIndividual states are explained in the following table.\n\n\n\nContainer State\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nWaiting\nThe container is waiting to be started. The reason and message fields indicate why the container is in this state.\n\n\nRunning\nThe container has been created and processes are running in it. The startedAt field indicates the time at which this container was started.\n\n\nTerminated\nThe processes that had been running in the container have terminated. The startedAt and finishedAt fields indicate when the container was started and when it terminated. The exit code with which the main process terminated is in the exitCode field.\n\n\nUnknown\nThe state of the container couldn’t be determined.\n\n\n\nTable 6.3 Possible container states\nDisplaying the status of the pod’s containers\nThe pod list displayed by kubectl get pods shows only the number of containers in each pod and how many of them are ready. To see the status of individual containers, you must use kubectl describe, as shown in the following listing.\nListing 6.3 Inspecting a container’s status using kubectl describe\n$ kubectl describe po kubia | grep Containers: -A15\nContainers:\n  kubia:\n    Container ID:   docker://c64944a684d57faacfced0be1af44686...\n    Image:          luksa/kubia:1.0\n    Image ID:       docker-pullable://luksa/kubia@sha256:3f28...\n    Port:           8080/TCP\n    Host Port:      0/TCP\n    State:          Running                                      #A\n      Started:      Sun, 02 Feb 2020 12:43:03 +0100              #A\n    Ready:          True                                         #B\n    Restart Count:  0                                            #C\n    Environment:    \n    Mounts:\n      ...\n\n#A The current state of the container and when it was started\n#B Whether the container is ready to provide its services\n#C How many times the container has been restarted\nFocus on the annotated lines in the listing, as they indicate whether the container is healthy. The kubia container is Running and is Ready. It has never been restarted.\nTIP\nYou can also display the container status(es) using jq like this: kubectl get po kubia -o json | jq .status.containerStatuses\n\nInspecting the status of an init container\nIn the previous chapter, you learned that in addition to regular containers, a pod can also have init containers that run when the pod starts. As with regular containers, the status of these containers is available in the status section of the pod object manifest, but in the initContainerStatuses field.\nINSPECTING THE STATUS OF THE KUBIA-INIT POD\nAs an additional exercise you can try on your own, create the pod defined in the kubia-init.yaml file from the previous chapter and inspect its phase, conditions and the status of its two regular and two init containers using kubectl describe and by retrieving the pod manifest using the kubectl get po kubia-init -o json | jq .status command.\n\n"},"docs/Keeping_containers_healthy.html":{"url":"docs/Keeping_containers_healthy.html","title":"6.2 Keeping containers healthy","keywords":"","body":"6.2 Keeping containers healthy\nThe pods you created in the previous chapter ran without any problems. But what if one of the containers dies? What if all the containers in a pod die? How do you keep the pods healthy and their containers running? That’s the focus of this section.\nUnderstanding container auto-restart\nWhen a pod is scheduled to a node, the Kubelet on that node starts its containers and from then on keeps them running for as long as the pod object exists. If the main process in the container terminates for any reason, the Kubelet restarts the container. If an error in your application causes it to crash, Kubernetes automatically restarts it, so even without doing anything special in the application itself, running it in Kubernetes automatically gives it the ability to heal itself. Let’s see this in action.\nObserving a container failure\nIn the previous chapter, you created the kubia-ssl pod, which contains the Node.js and the Envoy containers. Create the pod again and enable communication with the pod by running the following two commands:\n$ kubectl apply -f kubia-ssl.yaml\n$ kubectl port-forward kubia-ssl 8080 8443 9901\n\nYou’ll now cause the Envoy container to terminate to see how Kubernetes deals with the situation. Run the following command in a separate terminal so you can see how the pod’s status changes when one of its containers terminates:\n$ kubectl get pods -w\n\nYou’ll also want to watch events in another terminal using the following command:\n$ kubectl get events -w\n\nYou could emulate a crash of the container’s main process by sending it the KILL signal, but you can’t do this from inside the container because the Linux Kernel doesn’t let you kill the root process (the process with PID 1). You would have to SSH to the pod’s host node and kill the process from there. Fortunately, Envoy’s administration interface allows you to stop the process via its HTTP API.\nTo terminate the envoy container, open the URL http://localhost:9901 in your browser and click the quitquitquit button or run the following curl command in another terminal:\n$ curl -X POST http://localhost:9901/quitquitquit\nOK\n\nTo see what happens with the container and the pod it belongs to, examine the output of the kubectl get pods -w command you ran earlier. It’s shown in the next listing.\nListing 6.4 Pod state transitions when a container terminates\n$ kubectl get po -w\nNAME           READY   STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE\nkubia-ssl      2/2     Running    0          1s\nkubia-ssl      1/2     NotReady   0          9m33s\nkubia-ssl      2/2     Running    1          9m34s\n\nThe listing shows that the pod’s STATUS changes from Running to NotReady, while the READY column indicates that only one of the two containers is ready. Immediately thereafter, Kubernetes restarts the container and the pod’s status returns to Running. The RESTARTS column indicates that one container has been restarted.\nNOTE\nIf one of the pod’s containers fails, the other containers continue to run.\n\nNow examine the output of the kubectl get events -w command you ran earlier. It is shown in the next listing.\nListing 6.6 Events emitted when a container terminates\n$ kubectl get ev -w\nLAST SEEN   TYPE      REASON      OBJECT           MESSAGE\n0s          Normal    Pulled      pod/kubia-ssl    Container image already\n                                                   present on machine\n0s          Normal    Created     pod/kubia-ssl    Created container envoy\n0s          Normal    Started     pod/kubia-ssl    Started container envoy\n\nThe events show that the new envoy container has been started. You should be able to access the application via HTTPS again. Please confirm with your browser or curl.\nThe events in the listing also expose an important detail about how Kubernetes restarts containers. The second event indicates that the entire envoy container has been recreated. Kubernetes never restarts a container, but instead discards it and creates a new container. Regardless, we call this restarting a container.\nNOTE\nAny data that the process writes to the container’s filesystem is lost when the container is recreated. This behavior is sometimes undesirable. To persist data, you must add a storage volume to the pod, as explained in the next chapter.\n\nNOTE\nIf init containers are defined in the pod and one of the pod’s regular containers is restarted, the init containers are not executed again.\n\nConfiguring the pod’s restart policy\nBy default, Kubernetes restarts the container regardless of whether the process in the container exits with a zero or non-zero exit code - in other words, whether the container completes successfully or fails. This behavior can be changed by setting the restartPolicy field in the pod’s spec.\nThree restart policies exist. They are explained in the following figure.\nFigure 6.4 The pod’s restartPolicy determines whether its containers are restarted or not\n\nThe following table describes the three restart policies.\n|---|---|\n| Restart Policy | Description |\n| Always | Container is restarted regardless of the exit code the process in the container terminates with. This is the default restart policy. |\n| OnFailure | The container is restarted only if the process terminates with a non-zero exit code, which by convention indicates failure. |\n| Never | The container is never restarted - not even when it fails. |\nTable 6.4 Pod restart policies\nNOTE\nSurprisingly, the restart policy is configured at the pod level and applies to all its containers. It can’t be configured for each container individually.\n\nUnderstanding the time delay inserted before a container is restarted\nIf you call Envoy’s /quitquitquit endpoint several times, you’ll notice that each time it takes longer to restart the container after it terminates. The pod’s status is displayed as either NotReady or CrashLoopBackOff. Here’s what it means.\nAs shown in the following figure, the first time a container terminates, it is restarted immediately.  The next time, however, Kubernetes waits ten seconds before restarting it again. This delay is then doubled to 20, 40, 80 and then to 160 seconds after each subsequent termination. From then on, the delay is kept at five minutes. This delay that doubles between attempts is called exponential back-off.\nFigure 6.5 Exponential back-off between container restarts\n\nIn the worst case, a container can therefore be prevented from starting for up to five minutes.\nNOTE\nThe delay is reset to zero when the container has run successfully for 10 minutes. If the container must be restarted later, it is restarted immediately.\n\nAs you can see in the following listing, the container is in the Waiting state while it waits to be restarted, and the reason is shown as CrashLoopBackOff. The message field indicates how long it will take for the container to be restarted.\nListing 6.7 The state of a container that’s waiting to be restarted\n$ kubectl get po kubia-ssl -o json | jq .status.containerStatuses\n...\n\"state\": {\n  \"waiting\": {\n    \"message\": \"back-off 40s restarting failed container=envoy ...\",\n    \"reason\": \"CrashLoopBackOff\"\n\nNOTE\nWhen you tell Envoy to terminate, it terminates with exit code zero, which means it hasn’t crashed. The CrashLoopBackOff status can therefore be misleading.\n\nChecking the container’s health using liveness probes\nIn the previous section, you learned that Kubernetes keeps your application healthy by restarting it when its process terminates. But applications can also become unresponsive without terminating. For example, a Java application with a memory leak eventually starts spewing out OutOfMemoryErrors, but its JVM process continues to run. Ideally, Kubernetes should detect this kind of error and restart the container.\nThe application could catch these errors by itself and immediately terminate, but what about the situations where your application stops responding because it gets into an infinite loop or deadlock? What if the application can’t detect this? To ensure that the application is restarted in such cases, it may be necessary to check its state from the outside.\nIntroducing liveness probes\nKubernetes can be configured to check whether an application is still alive by defining a liveness probe. You can specify a liveness probe for each container in the pod. Kubernetes runs the probe periodically to ask the application if it’s still alive and well. If the application doesn’t respond, an error occurs, or the response is negative, the container is considered unhealthy and is terminated. The container is then restarted if the restart policy allows it.\nNOTE\nLiveness probes can only be used in the pod’s regular containers. They can’t be defined in init containers.\n\nTypes of liveness probes\nKubernetes can probe a container with one of the following three mechanisms:\n\nAn HTTP GET probe sends a GET request to the container’s IP address, on the network port and path you specify. If the probe receives a response, and the response code doesn’t represent an error (in other words, if the HTTP response code is 2xx or 3xx), the probe is considered successful. If the server returns an error response code, or if it doesn’t respond in time, the probe is considered to have failed.\nA TCP Socket probe attempts to open a TCP connection to the specified port of the container. If the connection is successfully established, the probe is considered successful. If the connection can’t be established in time, the probe is considered failed.\nAn Exec probe executes a command inside the container and checks the exit code it terminates with. If the exit code is zero, the probe is successful. A non-zero exit code is considered a failure. The probe is also considered to have failed if the command fails to terminate in time.\n\nNOTE\nIn addition to a liveness probe, a container may also have a startup probe, which is discussed in section 6.2.6, and a readiness probe, which is explained in chapter 10.\n\nCreating an HTTP GET liveness probe\nLet’s look at how to add a liveness probe to each of the containers in the kubia-ssl pod. Because they both run applications that understand HTTP, it makes sense to use an HTTP GET probe in each of them. The Node.js application doesn’t provide any endpoints to explicitly check the health of the application, but the Envoy proxy does. In real-world applications, you’ll encounter both cases.\nDefining liveness probes in the pod manifest\nThe following listing shows an updated manifest for the pod, which defines a liveness probe for each of the two containers, with different levels of configuration.\nListing 6.8 Adding a liveness probe to a pod: kubia-liveness.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: kubia-liveness\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: kubia\n    image: luksa/kubia:1.0\n    ports:\n    - name: http\n      containerPort: 8080\n    livenessProbe:                               #A\n      httpGet:                                   #A\n        path: /                                  #A\n        port: 8080                               #A\n  - name: envoy\n    image: luksa/kubia-ssl-proxy:1.0\n    ports:\n    - name: https\n      containerPort: 8443\n    - name: admin\n      containerPort: 9901\n    livenessProbe:                               #B\n      httpGet:                                   #B\n        path: /ready                             #B\n        port: admin                              #B\n      initialDelaySeconds: 10                    #B\n      periodSeconds: 5                           #B\n      timeoutSeconds: 2                          #B\n      failureThreshold: 3                        #B\n\n#A The liveness probe definition for the container running Node.js\n#B The liveness probe for the Envoy proxy\nThese liveness probes are explained in the next two sections.\nDefining a liveness probe using the minimum required configuration\nThe liveness probe for the kubia container is the simplest version of a probe for HTTP-based applications. The probe simply sends an HTTP GET request for the path / on port 8080 to determine if the container can still serve requests. If the application responds with an HTTP status between 200 and 399, the application is considered healthy.\nThe probe doesn’t specify any other fields, so the default settings are used. The first request is sent 10s after the container starts and is repeated every 10s. If the application doesn’t respond within one second, the probe attempt is considered failed. If it fails three times in a row, the container is considered unhealthy and is terminated.\nUnderstanding liveness probe configuration options\nThe administration interface of the Envoy proxy provides the special endpoint /ready through which it exposes its health status. Instead of targeting port 8443, which is the port through which Envoy forwards HTTPS requests to Node.js, the liveness probe for the envoy container targets this special endpoint on the admin port, which is port number 9901.\nNOTE\nAs you can see in the envoy container’s liveness probe, you can specify the probe’s target port by name instead of by number.\n\nThe liveness probe for the envoy container also contains additional fields. These are best explained with the following figure.\nFigure 6.6 The configuration and operation of a liveness probe\n\nThe parameter initialDelaySeconds determines how long Kubernetes should delay the execution of the first probe after starting the container. The periodSeconds field specifies the amount of time between the execution of two consecutive probes, whereas the timeoutSeconds field specifies how long to wait for a response before the probe attempt counts as failed. The failureThreshold field specifies how many times the probe must fail for the container to be considered unhealthy and potentially restarted.\nObserving the liveness probe in action\nTo see Kubernetes restart a container when its liveness probe fails, create the pod from the kubia-liveness.yaml manifest file using kubectl apply, and run kubectl port-forward to enable communication with the pod. You’ll need to stop the kubectl port-forward command still running from the previous exercise. Confirm that the pod is running and is responding to HTTP requests.\nObserving a successful liveness probe\nThe liveness probes for the pod’s containers starts firing soon after the start of each individual container. Since the processes in both containers are healthy, the probes continuously report success. As this is the normal state, the fact that the probes are successful is not explicitly indicated anywhere in the status of the pod nor in its events.\nThe only indication that Kubernetes is executing the probe is found in the container logs. The Node.js application in the kubia container prints a line to the standard output every time it handles an HTTP request. This includes the liveness probe requests, so you can display them using the following command:\n$ kubectl logs kubia-liveness -c kubia -f\n\nThe liveness probe for the envoy container is configured to send HTTP requests to Envoy’s administration interface, which doesn’t log HTTP requests to the standard output, but to the file /var/log/envoy.admin.log in the container’s filesystem. To display the log file, you use the following command:\n$ kubectl exec kubia-liveness -c envoy -- tail -f /var/log/envoy.admin.log\n\nObserving the liveness probe fail\nA successful liveness probe isn’t interesting, so let’s cause Envoy’s liveness probe to fail. To see what will happen behind the scenes, start watching events by executing the following command in a separate terminal:\n$ kubectl get events -w\n\nUsing Envoy’s administration interface, you can configure its health check endpoint to succeed or fail. To make it fail, open URL http://localhost:9901 in your browser and click the healthcheck/fail button, or use the following curl command:\n$ curl -X POST localhost:9901/healthcheck/fail\n\nImmediately after executing the command, observe the events that are displayed in the other terminal. When the probe fails, a Warning event is recorded, indicating the error and the HTTP status code returned:\nWarning  Unhealthy  Liveness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with code 503\n\nBecause the probe’s failureThreshold is set to three, a single failure is not enough to consider the container unhealthy, so it continues to run. You can make the liveness probe succeed again by clicking the healthcheck/ok button in Envoy’s admin interface, or by using curl as follows:\n$ curl -X POST localhost:9901/healthcheck/ok\n\nIf you are fast enough, the container won’t be restarted.\nObserving the liveness probe reach the failure threshold\nIf you let the liveness probe fail multiple times, you should see events like the ones in the next listing (note that some columns are omitted due to page width constraints).\nListing 6.9 Events recorded when a liveness probe fails\n$ kubectl get events -w\nTYPE     REASON     MESSAGE\nWarning  Unhealthy  Liveness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with code 503\nWarning  Unhealthy  Liveness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with code 503\nWarning  Unhealthy  Liveness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with code 503\nNormal   Killing    Container envoy failed liveness probe, will be\n                    restarted\nNormal   Pulled     Container image already present on machine\nNormal   Created    Created container envoy\nNormal   Started    Started container envoy\n\nRemember that the probe failure threshold is set to three, so when the probe fails three times in a row, the container is stopped and restarted. This is indicated by the events in the listing.\nThe kubectl get pods command shows that the container has been restarted:\n$ kubectl get po kubia-liveness\nNAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nkubia-liveness   2/2     Running   1          5m\n\nThe RESTARTS column shows that one container restart has taken place in the pod.\nUnderstanding how a container that fails its liveness probe is restarted\nIf you’re wondering whether the main process in the container was gracefully stopped or killed forcibly, you can check the pod’s status by retrieving the full manifest using kubectl get or using kubectl describe as shown in the following listing.\nListing 6.10 Inspecting the restarted container’s last state with kubectl describe\n$ kubectl describe po kubia-liveness\nName:           kubia-liveness\n...\nContainers:\n  ...\n  envoy:\n    ...\n    State:          Running                               #A\n      Started:      Sun, 31 May 2020 21:33:13 +0200       #A\n    Last State:     Terminated                            #B\n      Reason:       Completed                             #B\n      Exit Code:    0                                     #B\n      Started:      Sun, 31 May 2020 21:16:43 +0200       #B\n      Finished:     Sun, 31 May 2020 21:33:13 +0200       #B\n    ...\n\n#A This is the state of the new container.\n#B The previous container terminated with exit code 0.\nThe exit code zero shown in the listing implies that the application process gracefully exited on its own. If it had been killed, the exit code would have been 137.\nNOTE\nExit code 128+n indicates that the process exited due to external signal n. Exit code 137 is 128+9, where 9 represents the KILL signal. You’ll see this exit code whenever the container is killed. Exit code 143 is 128+15, where 15 is the TERM signal. You’ll typically see this exit code when the container runs a shell that has terminated gracefully.\n\nLet’s examine Envoy’s log to confirm that it caught the TERM signal and has terminated by itself. You must use the kubectl logs command with the --container or the shorter -c option to specify what container you’re interested in.\nAlso, because the container has been replaced with a new one due to the restart, you must request the log of the previous container using the --previous or -p flag. The next listing shows the full command and the last four lines of its output.\nListing 6.11 The last few lines of Envoy’s log when killed due to a failed liveness probe\n$ kubectl logs kubia-liveness -c envoy -p\n...\n...[warning][main] [source/server/server.cc:493] caught SIGTERM\n...[info][main] [source/server/server.cc:613] shutting down server instance\n...[info][main] [source/server/server.cc:560] main dispatch loop exited\n...[info][main] [source/server/server.cc:606] exiting\n\nThe log confirms that Kubernetes sent the TERM signal to the process, allowing it to shut down gracefully. Had it not terminated by itself, Kubernetes would have killed it forcibly.\nAfter the container is restarted, its health check endpoint responds with HTTP status 200 OK again, indicating that the container is healthy.\nUsing the exec and the tcpSocket liveness probe types\nFor applications that don’t expose HTTP health-check endpoints, the tcpSocket or the exec liveness probes should be used.\nAdding a tcpSocket liveness probe\nFor applications that accept non-HTTP TCP connections, a tcpSocket liveness probe can be configured. Kubernetes tries to open a socket to the TCP port and if the connection is established, the probe is considered a success, otherwise it's considered a failure.\nAn example of a tcpSocket liveness probe is shown in the following listing.\nListing 6.12 An example of a tcpSocket liveness probe\n    livenessProbe:\n      tcpSocket:                        #A\n        port: 1234                      #A\n      periodSeconds: 2                  #B\n      failureThreshold: 1               #C\n\n#A This tcpSocket probe uses TCP port 1234\n#B The probe runs every 2s\n#C A single probe failure is enough to restart the container\nThe probe in the listing is configured to check if the container’s network port 1234 is open. An attempt to establish a connection is made every two seconds and a single failed attempt is enough to consider the container as unhealthy.\nAdding an exec liveness probe\nApplications that do not accept TCP connections may provide a command to check their status. For these applications, an exec liveness probe is used. As shown in the next figure, the command is executed inside the container and must therefore be available on the container’s file system.\nFigure 6.7 The exec liveness probe runs the command inside the container\n\nThe following listing shows an example of a probe that runs /usr/bin/healthcheck every two seconds to determine if the application running in the container is still alive.\nListing 6.13 An example of an exec liveness probe\n    livenessProbe:\n      exec:\n        command:                        #A\n        - /usr/bin/healthcheck          #A\n      periodSeconds: 2                  #B\n      timeoutSeconds: 1                 #C\n      failureThreshold: 1               #D\n\n#A The command to run and its arguments\n#B The probe runs every second\n#C The command must return within one second\n#D A single probe failure is enough to restart the container\nIf the command returns exit code zero, the container is considered healthy. If it returns a non-zero exit code or fails to complete within one second as specified in the timeoutSeconds field, the container is terminated immediately, as configured in the failureThreshold field, which indicates that a single probe failure is sufficient to consider the container as unhealthy.\nUsing a startup probe when an application is slow to start\nThe default liveness probe settings give the application between 20 and 30 seconds to start responding to liveness probe requests. If the application takes longer to start, it is restarted and must start again. If the second start also takes as long, it is restarted again. If this continues, the container never reaches the state where the liveness probe succeeds and gets stuck in an endless restart loop.\nTo prevent this, you can increase the initialDelaySeconds, periodSeconds or failureThreshold settings to account for the long start time, but this will have a negative effect on the normal operation of the application. The higher the result of periodSeconds * failureThreshold, the longer it takes to restart the application if it becomes unhealthy. For applications that take minutes to start, increasing these parameters enough to prevent the application from being restarted prematurely may not be a viable option.\nIntroducing startup probes\nTo deal with the discrepancy between the start and the steady-state operation of an application, Kubernetes also provides startup probes.\nIf a startup probe is defined for a container, only the startup probe is executed when the container is started. The startup probe can be configured to take into account the slow start of the application. When the startup probe succeeds, Kubernetes switches to using the liveness probe, which is configured to quickly detect when the application becomes unhealthy.\nAdding a startup probe to a pod’s manifest\nImagine that the kubia Node.js application needs more than a minute to warm up, but you want it to be restarted within 10 seconds after it has become unhealthy during normal operation. The following listing shows how you’d configure the startup and the liveness probes.\nListing 6.14 Using a combination of startup and liveness probes\n  containers:\n  - name: kubia\n    image: luksa/kubia:1.0\n    ports:\n    - name: http\n      containerPort: 8080\n    startupProbe:\n      httpGet:\n        path: /                   #A\n        port: http                #A\n      periodSeconds: 10           #B\n      failureThreshold:  12       #B\n    livenessProbe:\n      httpGet:\n        path: /                   #A\n        port: http                #A\n      periodSeconds: 5            #C\n      failureThreshold: 2         #C\n\n#A The startup and the liveness probes typically use the same endpoint\n#B The application gets 120 seconds to start\n#C After startup, the application’s health is checked every 5 seconds, and is restarted when it fails the liveness probe twice\nWhen the container defined in the listing starts, the application has 120 seconds to start responding to requests. Kubernetes performs the startup probe every 10 seconds and makes a maximum of 12 attempts.\nAs shown in the following figure, unlike liveness probes, it’s perfectly normal for a startup probe to fail. A failure only indicates that the application hasn’t yet been completely started. A successful startup probe indicates that the application has started successfully, and Kubernetes should switch to the liveness probe. The liveness probe is then typically executed using a shorter period of time, which allows for faster detection of non-responsive applications.\nFigure 6.8 Fast detection of application health problems using a combination of startup and liveness probe\n\nNOTE\nIf the startup probe fails often enough to reach the failureThreshold, the container is terminated as it the liveness probe had failed.\n\nUsually, the startup and liveness probes are configured to use the same HTTP endpoint, but different endpoints can be used. You can also configure the startup probe as an exec or tcpSocket probe instead of an httpGet probe.\nCreating effective liveness probe handlers\nYou should define a liveness probe for all your pods. Without one, Kubernetes has no way of knowing whether your app is still alive or not, apart from checking whether the application process has terminated.\nCausing unnecessary restarts with badly implemented liveness probe handlers\nWhen you implement a handler for the liveness probe, either as an HTTP endpoint in your application or as an additional executable command, be very careful to implement it correctly. If a poorly implemented probe returns a negative response even though the application is healthy, the application will be restarted unnecessarily. Many Kubernetes users learn this the hard way. If you can make sure that the application process terminates by itself when it becomes unhealthy, it may be safer not to define a liveness probe.\nWhat a liveness probe should check\nThe liveness probe for the kubia container isn’t configured to call an actual health-check endpoint, but only checks that the Node.js server responds to simple HTTP requests for the root URI. This may seem overly simple, but even such a liveness probe works wonders, because it causes a restart of the container if the server no longer responds to HTTP requests, which is its main task. If no liveness probe was defined, the pod would remain in an unhealthy state where it doesn’t respond to any requests and would have to be restarted manually. A simple liveness probe like this is better than nothing.\nTo provide a better liveness check, web applications typically expose a specific health-check endpoint, such as /healthz. When this endpoint is called, the application performs an internal status check of all the major components running within the application to ensure that none of them have died or are no longer doing what they should.\nTIP\nMake sure that the /healthz HTTP endpoint doesn’t require authentication; otherwise the probe will always fail, causing your container to be restarted indefinitely.\n\nMake sure that the application checks only the operation of its internal components and nothing that is influenced by an external factor. For example, the health-check endpoint of a frontend service should never respond with failure when it can’t connect to a backend service. If the backend service fails, restarting the frontend will not solve the problem. Such a liveness probe will fail again after the restart, so the container will be restarted repeatedly until the backend is repaired. If many services are interdependent in this way, the failure of a single service can result in cascading failures across the entire system.\nKeeping probes light\nThe handler invoked by a liveness probe shouldn’t use too much computing resources and shouldn’t take too long to complete. By default, probes are executed relatively often and only given one second to complete.\nUsing a handler that consumes a lot of CPU or memory can seriously affect the main process of your container. Later in the book you’ll learn how to limit the CPU time and total memory available to a container. The CPU and memory consumed by the probe handler invocation count towards the resource quota of the container, so using a resource-intensive handler will reduce the CPU time available to the main process of the application.\nTIP\nWhen running a Java application in your container, you may want to use an HTTP GET probe instead of an exec liveness probe that starts an entire JVM. The same applies to commands that require considerable computing resources.\n\nAvoiding retry loops in your probe handlers\nYou’ve learned that the failure threshold for the probe is configurable. Instead of implementing a retry loop in your probe handlers, keep it simple and instead set the failureThreshold field to a higher value so that the probe must fail several times before the application is considered unhealthy. Implementing your own retry mechanism in the handler is a waste of effort and represents another potential point of failure.\n"},"docs/Executing_actions_at_container_startup_and_shutdown.html":{"url":"docs/Executing_actions_at_container_startup_and_shutdown.html","title":"6.3 Executing actions at container start-up and shutdown","keywords":"","body":"6.3 Executing actions at container start-up and shutdown\nIn the previous chapter you learned that you can use init containers to run containers at the start of the pod lifecycle. You may also want to run additional processes every time a container starts and just before it stops. You can do this by adding lifecycle hooks to the container. Two types of hooks are currently supported:\n\nPost-start hooks, which are executed when the container is started, and\nPre-stop hooks, which are executed shortly before the container stops.\n\nThese lifecycle hooks are specified per container, as opposed to init containers, which are specified at the pod level. The next figure should help you visualize how lifecycle hooks fit into the lifecycle of a container.\nFigure 6.9 How the post-start and pre-stop hook fit into the container’s lifecycle\n\nLike liveness probes, lifecycle hooks can be used to either\n\nexecute a command inside the container, or\nsend an HTTP GET request to the application in the container.\n\nNOTE\nThe same as with liveness probes, lifecycle hooks can only be applied to regular containers and not to init containers. Unlike probes, lifecycle hooks do not support tcpSocket handlers.\n\nLet’s look at the two types of hooks individually to see what you can use them for.\nUsing post-start hooks to perform actions when the container starts\nThe post-start lifecycle hook is invoked immediately after the container is created. You can use the exec type of the hook to execute an additional process as the main process starts, or you can use the httpGet hook to send an HTTP request to the application running in the container to perform some type of initialization or warm-up procedure.\nIf you’re the author of the application, you could perform the same operation within the application code itself, but if you need to add it to an existing application that you didn’t create yourself, you may not be able to do so. A post-start hook provides a simple alternative that doesn’t require you to change the application or its container image.\nLet’s look at an example of how a post-start hook can be used in a new service you’ll create.\nUsing a post-start container lifecycle hook to run a command in the container\nDuring my first steps with Unix in the 1990s, one of the things I found amusing was the random, sometimes funny message that the fortune command displayed every time I logged into our high school’s server, which was running the Solaris OS at the time. Nowadays, you’ll rarely see the fortune command installed on Unix/Linux systems anymore, but you can still install it and run it whenever you’re bored. Here’s an example of what it may display:\n$ fortune\nDinner is ready when the smoke alarm goes off.\n\nIn the following exercise, you’ll combine the fortune program with the Nginx web server to create a web-based fortune service.\nFor the first version of the service, the fortune command will write the message to a file, which will then be served by Nginx. Although this means that the same message is returned in every request, this is a perfectly good start. You’ll later improve the service iteratively.\nThe Nginx web server is available as a container image, so let’s use it. Because the fortune command is not available in the image, you’d normally build a new image based on the Nginx image and install the fortune package during the container build process.\nLet’s keep things ultra simple for now and both install and run the fortune command when the container starts. Although this is not something you should normally do, a post-start hook can be used for this. The following listing shows the pod manifest that defines a post-start hook that does this.\nListing 6.15 Pod with a post-start lifecycle hook\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: fortune-poststart                                                 #A\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: nginx                                                           #B\n    image: nginx:alpine                                                   #B\n    lifecycle:                                                            #C\n      postStart:                                                          #C\n        exec:                                                             #C\n          command:                                                        #C\n          - sh                                                            #D\n          - -c                                                            #D\n          - \"apk add fortune && fortune > /usr/share/nginx/html/quote\"    #D\n    ports:                                                                #E\n    - name: http                                                          #E\n      containerPort: 80                                                   #E\n\n#A Let’s name this pod fortune-poststart\n#B The nginx:alpine container image is used in this single-container pod\n#C A post-start lifecycle hook is used to run a command when the container starts\n#D This is the shell command that is executed\n#E The Nginx server runs on port 80\nThe pod is named fortune-poststart and contains a single container based on the nginx:alpine image. A postStart lifecycle hook is defined for the container. It executes the following command when the Nginx server is started:\nsh -c \"apk add fortune && fortune > /usr/share/nginx/html/quote\"\n\nLet me break the command down for you. It executes the sh shell that runs the following two commands:\n\nThe apk add fortune command runs the Alpine Linux package management tool, which is part of the image that nginx:alpine is based on, to install the fortune package in the container.\nThe fortune command is executed, and its output is redirected to the /usr/share/nginx/html/quote file.\n\nThe command runs parallel to the main process. The postStart name is somewhat misleading, because the hook isn’t called after the main process is fully started, but as soon as the container is created, at roughly the same time as when the main process starts. When the postStart hook is finished, the quote produced by the fortune command is stored in the file and is ready to be served by Nginx.\nUse the kubectl apply command to create the pod from the fortune-poststart.yaml file, and you should then be able to use curl or your browser to get the quote at URI /quote on port 80 of the fortune-poststart pod. You’ve already learned how to do this, but you may want to refer to the sidebar because there is a caveat.\nACCESSING THE FORTUNE-POSTSTART POD\nTo retrieve the quote from the fortune-poststart pod, you must first run the kubectl port-forward command, which may fail as shown here:\n$ kubectl port-forward fortune-poststart 80\nUnable to listen on port 80: Listeners failed to create with the following errors: [unable to create listener: Error listen tcp4 127.0.0.1:80: bind: permission denied unable to create listener: Error listen tcp6 [::1]:80: bind: permission denied]\nerror: unable to listen on any of the requested ports: [{80 80}]\n\nThe command fails if your operating system doesn’t allow you to run processes that bind to port numbers 0-1023. To fix this, you must use a higher local port number as follows:\n$ kubectl port-forward fortune-poststart 1080:80\n\nThe last argument tells kubectl to use port 1080 locally and forward it to port 80 of the pod.\nYou can now access the fortune service at http://localhost:1080/quote.\n\nUnderstanding how a post-start hook affects the container\nAlthough the post-start hook runs asynchronously with the main container process, it affects the container in two ways.\nFirst, the container remains in the Waiting state with the reason ContainerCreating until the hook invocation is completed. The phase of the pod is Pending. If you run the kubectl logs command at this point, it refuses to show the logs, even though the container is running. The kubectl port-forward command also refuses to forward ports to the pod.\nIf you want to see this for yourself, deploy the fortune-poststart-slow.yaml pod manifest file that you can find in the code archive of the book. It defines a post-start hook that takes 60 seconds to complete. Immediately after the pod is created, inspect its state, and display the logs with the following command:\n$ kubectl logs fortune-poststart-slow\nError from server (BadRequest): container \"nginx\" in pod \"fortune-poststart-slow\" is waiting to start: ContainerCreating\n\nThe error message returned implies that the container hasn’t started yet, which isn’t the case. To prove this, use the command in the following listing to list processes in the container:\nListing 6.16 Processes running in a container while the post-start hooks runs\n$ kubectl exec fortune-poststart-slow -- ps x\nPID   USER     TIME  COMMAND\n  1 root      0:00 nginx: master process nginx -g daemon off;           #A\n  7 root      0:00 sh -c sleep 60 && apk add fortune && fortune > ...   #B\n 13 nginx     0:00 nginx: worker process                                #A\n...                                                                     #A\n 20 nginx     0:00 nginx: worker process                                #A\n 21 root      0:00 sleep 60                                             #B\n 22 root      0:00 ps x\n\n#A Nginx is running\n#B The post-start hook processes\nThe other way a post-start hook can affect the container is if the command used in the hook can’t be executed or returns a non-zero exit code. If this happens, the entire container is restarted. To see an example of a post-start hook that fails, deploy the pod manifest fortune-poststart-fail.yaml.\nIf you watch the pod’s status using kubectl get pods -w, you’ll see the following status:\nfortune-poststart-fail   0/1     PostStartHookError: command 'sh -c echo 'Emulating a post-start hook failure'; exit 1' exited with 1:\n\nIt shows the command that was executed and the code with which it terminated. When you review the pod events shown in the following listing, you’ll see a FailedPostStartHook warning event that indicates the exit code and what the command printed to the standard or error output.\nListing 6.17 Event showing the exit code and output of a failed postStart hook\nWarning  FailedPostStartHook  Exec lifecycle hook ([sh -c ...]) for\n                              Container \"nginx\" in Pod \"fortune-poststart-\n                              fail_default(...)\" failed - error: command\n                              '...' exited with 1: , message: \"Emulating a\n                              post-start hook failure\\n\"\n\nThe same information is also contained in the containerStatuses field in the pod’s status field, but only for a short time, as the container status changes to CrashLoopBackOff shortly afterwards.\nTIP\nBecause the state of a pod can change quickly, inspecting just its status may not tell you everything you need to know. Rather than inspecting the state at a particular moment in time, reviewing the pod’s events is usually a better way to get the full picture.\n\nCapturing the output produced by the process invoked via a post-start hook\nAs you’ve just learned, the output of the command defined in the post-start hook can be inspected if it fails. In cases where the command completes successfully, the output of the command is not logged anywhere. To see the output, the command must log to a file instead of the standard or error output. You can then view the contents of the file with a command like the following:\n$ kubectl exec my-pod -- cat logfile.txt\n\nUsing an HTTP GET post-start hook\nIn the previous example, you configured the post-start hook to invoke a command inside the container. Alternatively, you can have Kubernetes send an HTTP GET request when it starts the container by using an httpGet post-start hook.\nNOTE\nYou can’t specify both an exec and an httpGet post-start hook for a container. You can only specify one.\n\nFor example, when starting a web application inside a container, you may want to use a post-start hook to send an initial request to the application so that it can initialize its caches or warm up its other internal components, which allows the first request sent by an actual client to be processed more quickly.\nThe following listing shows an example of a post-start hook definition that does this:\nListing 6.18 Using an httpGet post-start hook to warm up a web server\n    lifecycle:                 #A\n      postStart:               #A\n        httpGet:               #A\n          port: 80             #B\n          path: /warmup        #B\n\n#A This is a post-start lifecycle hook that performs an HTTP GET request\n#B The request is sent to port 80 of the pod\n#C The URI requested in the HTTP GET request\nThe example in the listing shows an httpGet post-start hook that calls the /warmup URI on port 80 of the pod. You can find this example in the poststart-httpget.yaml file in the book’s code archive.\nIn addition to the port and path shown in the listing, you can also specify the scheme (HTTP or HTTPS) and host fields, as well as the httpHeaders to be sent in the request. The host field defaults to the pod IP. Be careful not to set it to localhost, because localhost refers to the node hosting the pod, not the pod itself.\nAs with command-based post-start hooks, the HTTP GET post-start hook is executed immediately when the container’s main process starts. This can be problematic if the process doesn’t start up immediately. As you’ve already learned, the container is restarted if the post-start hook fails. To see this for yourself, try creating the pod defined in poststart-httpget-slow.yaml.\nWARNING\nUsing an HTTP GET post-start hook with applications that don’t immediately start accepting connections can cause the container to enter an endless restart loop.\n\nInterestingly, Kubernetes doesn’t treat the hook as failed if the HTTP server responds with an HTTP error code like 404 Not Found. Make sure you specify the correct URI in your HTTP GET hook, otherwise you might not even notice that the post-start hook does nothing.\nRunning a process just before the container terminates\nBesides executing a command or sending an HTTP request at container startup, Kubernetes also allows the definition of a pre-stop hook in your containers.\nA pre-stop hook is executed immediately before a container is terminated. To terminate a process, the TERM signal is usually sent to it. This tells the application to finish what it’s doing and shut down. The same happens with containers. Whenever a container needs to be stopped or restarted, the TERM signal is sent to the main process in the container. Before this happens, however, Kubernetes first executes the pre-stop hook, if one is configured for the container. The TERM signal is not sent until the pre-stop hook completes unless the process has already terminated due to the invocation of the pre-stop hook handler itself.\nNOTE\nWhen container termination is initiated, the liveness and other probes are no longer invoked.\n\nA pre-stop hook can be used to initiate a graceful shutdown of the container or to perform additional operations without having to implement them in the application itself. As with post-start hooks, you can either execute a command within the container or send an HTTP request to the application running in it.\nUsing a pre-stop lifecycle hook to shut down a container gracefully\nThe Nginx web server used in the fortune pod responds to the TERM signal by immediately closing all open connections and terminating the process. This is not ideal, as the client requests that are being processed at this time aren’t allowed to complete.\nFortunately, you can instruct Nginx to shut down gracefully by running the command nginx -s quit. When you run this command, the server stops accepting new connections, waits until all in-flight requests have been processed, and then quits.\nWhen you run Nginx in a Kubernetes pod, you can use a pre-stop lifecycle hook to run this command and ensure that the pod shuts down gracefully. The following listing shows the definition of this pre-stop hook. You can find it in the fortune-prestop.yaml pod manifest.\nListing 6.19 Defining a pre-stop hook for Nginx\n    lifecycle:                   #A\n      preStop:                   #A\n        exec:                    #B\n          command:               #B\n          - nginx                #C\n          - -s                   #C\n          - quit                 #C\n\n#A This is a pre-stop lifecycle hook\n#B It executes a command\n#C This is the command that gets executed\nWhenever a container using this pre-stop hook is terminated, the command nginx -s quit is executed in the container before the main process of the container receives the TERM signal.\nUnlike the post-start hook, the container is terminated regardless of the result of the pre-stop hook - a failure to execute the command or a non-zero exit code does not prevent the container from being terminated. If the pre-stop hook fails, you’ll see a FailedPreStopHook warning event among the pod events, but you might not see any indication of the failure if you are only monitoring the status of the pod.\nTIP \nIf successful completion of the pre-stop hook is critical to the proper operation of your system, make sure that it runs successfully. I’ve experienced situations where the pre-stop hook didn’t run at all, but the engineers weren’t even aware of it.\n\nLike post-start hooks, you can also configure the pre-stop hook to send an HTTP GET request to your application instead of executing commands. The configuration of the HTTP GET pre-stop hook is the same as for a post-start hook. For more information, see section 6.3.1.\nAPPLICATION NOT RECEIVING THE TERM SIGNAL\nMany developers make the mistake of defining a pre-stop hook just to send a TERM signal to their applications in the pre-stop hook. They do this when they find that their application never receives the TERM signal. The root cause is usually not that the signal is never sent, but that it is swallowed by something inside the container. This typically happens when you use the shell form of the ENTRYPOINT or the CMD directive in your Dockerfile. Two forms of these directives exist.\nThe exec form is: ENTRYPOINT [\"/myexecutable\", \"1st-arg\", \"2nd-arg\"]\nThe shell form is: ENTRYPOINT /myexecutable 1st-arg 2nd-arg\nWhen you use the exec form, the executable file is called directly. The process it starts becomes the root process of the container. When you use the shell form, a shell runs as the root process, and the shell runs the executable as its child process. In this case, the shell process is the one that receives the TERM signal. Unfortunately, it doesn’t pass this signal to the child process.\nIn such cases, instead of adding a pre-stop hook to send the TERM signal to your app, the correct solution is to use the exec form of ENTRYPOINT or CMD.\nNote that the same problem occurs if you use a shell script in your container to run the application. In this case, you must either intercept and pass signals to the application or use the exec shell command to run the application in your script.\n\nPre-stop hooks are only invoked when the container is requested to terminate, either because it has failed its liveness probe or because the pod has to shut down. They are not called when the process running in the container terminates by itself.\nUnderstanding that lifecycle hooks target containers, not pods\nAs a final consideration on the post-start and pre-stop hooks, I would like to emphasize that these lifecycle hooks apply to containers and not to pods. You shouldn’t use a pre-stop hook to perform an action that needs to be performed when the entire pod is shut down, because pre-stop hooks run every time the container needs to terminate. This can happen several times during the pod’s lifetime, not just when the pod shuts down.\n"},"docs/Understanding_the_pod_lifecycle.html":{"url":"docs/Understanding_the_pod_lifecycle.html","title":"6.4 Understanding the pod lifecycle","keywords":"","body":"6.4 Understanding the pod lifecycle\nSo far in this chapter you’ve learned a lot about how the containers in a pod run. Now let’s take a closer look at the entire lifecycle of a pod and its containers.\nWhen you create a pod object, Kubernetes schedules it to a worker node that then runs its containers. The pod’s lifecycle is divided into the three stages shown in the next figure:\nFigure 6.10 The three stages of the pod’s lifecycle\n\nThe three stages of the pod’s lifecycle are:\n\nThe initialization stage, during which the pod’s init containers run.\nThe run stage, in which the regular containers of the pod run.\nThe termination stage, in which the pod’s containers are terminated.\n\nLet’s see what happens in each of these stages.\nUnderstanding the initialization stage\nAs you’ve already learned, the pod’s init containers run first. They run in the order specified in the initContainers field in the pod’s spec. Let me explain everything that unfolds.\nPulling the container image\nBefore each init container is started, its container image is pulled to the worker node. The imagePullPolicy field in the container definition in the pod specification determines whether the image is pulled every time, only the first time, or never.\n\n\n\nImage pull policy\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nNot specified\nIf the imagePullPolicy is not explicitly specified, it defaults to Always if the :latest tag is used in the image. For other image tags, it defaults to IfNotPresent.\n\n\nAlways\nThe image is pulled every time the container is (re)started. If the locally cached image matches the one in the registry, it is not downloaded again, but the registry still needs to be contacted.\n\n\nNever\nThe container image is never pulled from the registry. It must exist on the worker node beforehand. Either it was stored locally when another container with the same image was deployed, or it was built on the node itself, or simply downloaded by someone or something else.\n\n\nIfNotPresent\nImage is pulled if it is not already present on the worker node. This ensures that the image is only pulled the first time it’s required.\n\n\n\nTable 6.5 List of image-pull policies\nThe image-pull policy is also applied every time the container is restarted, so a closer look is warranted. Examine the following figure to understand the behavior of these three policies.\nFigure 6.11 An overview of the three different image-pull policies\n\nWARNING\nIf the imagePullPolicy is set to Always and the image registry is offline, the container will not run even if the same image is already stored locally. A registry that is unavailable may therefore prevent your application from (re)starting.\n\nRunning the containers\nWhen the first container image is downloaded to the node, the container is started. When the first init container is complete, the image for the next init container is pulled and the container is started. This process is repeated until all init containers are successfully completed. Containers that fail might be restarted, as shown in the following figure.\nFigure 6.12 All init containers must run to completion before the regular containers can start\n\nRestarting failed init containers\nIf an init container terminates with an error and the pod’s restart policy is set to Always or OnFailure, the failed init container is restarted. If the policy is set to Never, the subsequent init containers and the pod’s regular containers are never started. The pod’s status is displayed as Init:Error indefinitely. You must then delete and recreate the pod object to restart the application. For an example of such a pod, see the fortune-init-fail-norestart.yaml file in the book’s code archive.\nNOTE\nIf the container needs to be restarted and imagePullPolicy is set to Always, the container image is pulled again. If the container had terminated due to an error and you push a new image with the same tag that fixes the error, you don’t need to recreate the pod, as the updated container image will be pulled before the container is restarted.\n\nRe-executing the pod’s init containers\nInit containers are normally only executed once. Even if one of the pod’s main containers is terminated later, the pod’s init containers are not re-executed. However, in exceptional cases, such as when Kubernetes must restart the entire pod, the pod’s init containers might be executed again. This means that the operations performed by your init containers must be idempotent.\nUnderstanding the run stage\nWhen all init containers are successfully completed, the pod’s regular containers are all created in parallel. In theory, the lifecycle of each container should be independent of the other containers in the pod, but this is not quite true. See sidebar for more information.\nA CONTAINER’S POST-START HOOK BLOCKS THE CREATION OF THE NEXT CONTAINER\nThe Kubelet doesn’t start all containers of the pod at the same time. It creates and starts the containers synchronously in the order they are defined in the pod’s spec. If a post-start hook is defined for a container, it runs asynchronously with the main container process, but the execution of the post-start hook handler blocks the creation and start of the subsequent containers.\nThis is an implementation detail that might change in the future.\nIn contrast, the termination of containers is performed in parallel. A long-running pre-stop hook does block the shutdown of the container in which it is defined, but it does not block the shutdown of other containers. The pre-stop hooks of the containers are all invoked at the same time.\nThe following sequence runs independently for each container. First, the container image is pulled, and the container is started. When the container terminates, it is restarted, if this is provided for in the pod’s restart policy. The container continues to run until the termination of the pod is initiated. A more detailed explanation of this sequence is presented next.\nPulling the container image\nBefore the container is created, its image is pulled from the image registry, following the pod’s imagePullPolicy. Once the image is pulled, the container is created.\nNOTE\nIf one of the container images can’t be pulled, the other containers run anyway.\n\nWARNING\nContainers don’t necessarily start at the same moment. If pulling the image takes a long time, the container may start well after all the others have already started. Bear this in mind if one of your containers depends on another.\n\nRunning the container\nThe container starts when the main container process starts. If a post-start hook is defined in the container, it is invoked in parallel with the main container process. The post-start hook runs asynchronously and must be successful for the container to continue running.\nTogether with the main container and the potential post-start hook process, the startup probe, if defined for the container, is started. When the startup probe is successful, or if the startup probe is not configured, the liveness probe is started.\nTerminating and restarting the container on failures\nIf the startup or the liveness probe fails so often that it reaches the configured failure threshold, the container is terminated. As with init containers, the pod’s restartPolicy determines whether the container is then restarted or not.\nPerhaps surprisingly, if the restart policy is set to Never and the startup hook fails, the pod’s status is shown as Completed even though the post-start hook failed. You can see this for yourself by creating the pod in the fortune-poststart-fail-norestart.yaml file.\nIntroducing the termination grace period\nIf a container must be terminated, the container’s pre-stop hook is called so that the application can shut down gracefully. When the pre-stop hook is completed, or if no pre-stop hook is defined, the TERM signal is sent to the main container process. This is another hint to the application that it should shut down.\nThe application is given a certain amount of time to terminate. This time can be configured using the terminationGracePeriodSeconds field in the pod’s spec and defaults to 30 seconds. The timer starts when the pre-stop hook is called or when the TERM signal is sent if no hook is defined. If the process is still running after the termination grace period has expired, it’s terminated by force via the KILL signal. This terminates the container.\nThe following figure illustrates the container termination sequence.\nFigure 6.13 A container’s termination sequence\n\nAfter the container has terminated, it will be restarted if the pod’s restart policy allows it. If not, the container will remain in the Terminated state, but the other containers will continue running until the entire pod is shut down or until they fail as well.\nUnderstanding the termination stage\nThe pod’s containers continue to run until you finally delete the pod object. When this happens, termination of all containers in the pod is initiated and its status is changed to Terminating.\nIntroducing the deletion grace period\nThe termination of each container at pod shutdown follows the same sequence as when the container is terminated because it has failed its liveness probe, except that instead of the termination grace period, the pod’s deletion grace period determines how much time is available to the containers to shut down on their own.\nThis grace period is defined in the pod’s metadata.deletionGracePeriodSeconds field, which gets initialized when you delete the pod. By default, it gets its value from the spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds field, but you can specify a different value in the kubectl delete command. You’ll see how to do this later.\nUnderstanding how the pod’s containers are terminated\nAs shown in the next figure, the pod’s containers are terminated in parallel. For each of the pod’s containers, the container’s pre-stop hook is called, the TERM signal is then sent to the main container process, and finally the process is terminated using the KILL signal if the deletion grace period expires before the process stops by itself. After all the containers in the pod have stopped running, the pod object is deleted.\nFigure 6.14 The termination sequence inside a pod\n\nInspecting the slow shutdown of a pod\nLet’s look at this last stage of the pod’s life on one of the pods you created previously. If the kubia-ssl pod doesn’t run in your cluster, please create it again. Now delete the pod by running kubectl delete pod kubia-ssl.\nIt takes surprisingly long to delete the pod, doesn’t it? I counted at least 30 seconds. This is neither normal nor acceptable, so let’s fix it.\nConsidering what you’ve learned in this section, you may already know what’s causing the pod to take so long to finish. If not, let me help you analyze the situation.\nThe kubia-ssl pod has two containers. Both must stop before the pod object can be deleted. Neither container has a pre-stop hook defined, so both containers should receive the TERM signal immediately when you delete the pod. The 30s I mentioned earlier match the default termination grace period value, so it looks like one of the containers, if not both, doesn’t stop when it receives the TERM signal, and is killed after the grace period expires.\nChanging the termination grace period\nYou could set the pod’s terminationGracePeriodSeconds field to a lower value, as shown in the following listing, and see if the pod shuts down faster.\nListing 6.20 Setting a lower terminationGracePeriodSeconds for faster pod shutdown\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: kubia-ssl-shortgraceperiod\nspec:\n  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 5             #A\n  containers:\n  ...\n\n#A This pod’s containers have 5 seconds to terminate after receiving the TERM signal or they will be killed\nIn the listing above, the pod’s terminationGracePeriodSeconds is set to 5. If you create and then delete this pod, you’ll see that its containers are terminated within 5s of receiving the TERM signal.\nTIP\nA reduction of the termination grace period is rarely necessary. However, it is advisable to extend it if the application usually needs more time to shut down gracefully.\n\nSpecifying the deletion grace period when deleting the pod\nAny time you delete a pod, the pod’s terminationGracePeriodSeconds determines the amount of time the pod is given to shut down, but you can override this time when you execute the kubectl delete command using the --grace-period command line option.\nFor example, to give the pod 10s to shut down, you run the following command:\n$ kubectl delete po kubia-ssl --grace-period 10\n\nNOTE\nIf you set this grace period to zero, the pod’s pre-stop hooks are not executed.\n\nFixing the shutdown behavior of the kubia application\nConsidering that the shortening of the grace period leads to a faster shutdown of the pod, it’s clear that at least one of the two containers doesn’t terminate by itself after it receives the TERM signal. To see which one, recreate the pod, then run the following commands to stream the logs of each container before deleting the pod again:\n$ kubectl logs kubia-ssl -c kubia -f\n$ kubectl logs kubia-ssl -c envoy -f\n\nThe logs show that the Envoy proxy catches the signal and immediately terminates, whereas the Node.js application doesn’t seem to respond to the signal. To fix this, you need to add the code shown in the following listing to the end of the app.js file. You can find the modified file in the Chapter06/kubia-v2-image directory in the code archive of the book.\nListing 6.21 Handling the TERM signal in the kubia application\nprocess.on('SIGTERM', function () {\n  console.log(\"Received SIGTERM. Server shutting down...\");\n  server.close(function () {\n    process.exit(0);\n  });\n});\n\nAfter you make the change to the code, create a new container image with the tag :1.1, push it to your image registry, and deploy a new pod that uses the new image. If you don’t want to bother to create the image, you can also use the image luksa/kubia:1.1, which is published on Docker Hub. To create the pod, apply the manifest in the file kubia-ssl-v1-1.yaml, which you can find in the book’s code archive.\nIf you delete this new pod, you’ll see that it shuts down considerably faster. From the logs of the kubia container, you can see that it begins to shut down as soon as it receives the TERM signal.\nTIP\nYou should make sure that your init containers also handle the TERM signal so that they shut down immediately if you delete the pod object while it’s still being initialized.\n\nVisualizing the full lifecycle of the pod’s containers\nTo conclude this chapter on what goes on in a pod, I present a final overview of everything that happens during the life of a pod. The following two figures summarize everything that has been explained in this chapter. The initialization of the pod is shown in the next figure.\nFigure 6.15 Complete overview of the pod’s initialization stage\n\nWhen initialization is complete, normal operation of the pod’s containers begins. This is shown in the next figure.\nFigure 6.16 Complete overview of the pod’s normal operation\n\n"},"docs/Summary_6.html":{"url":"docs/Summary_6.html","title":"6.5 Summary","keywords":"","body":"6.5 Summary\nIn this chapter, you’ve learned:\n\nThe status of the pod contains information about the phase of the pod, its conditions, and the status of each of its containers. You can view the status by running the kubectl describe command or by retrieving the full pod manifest using the command kubectl get -o yaml.\nDepending on the pod’s restart policy, its containers can be restarted after they are terminated. In reality, a container is never actually restarted. Instead, the old container is destroyed, and a new container is created in its place.\nIf a container is repeatedly terminated, an exponentially increasing delay is inserted before each restart. There is no delay for the first restart, then the delay is 10 seconds and then doubles before each subsequent restart. The maximum delay is 5 minutes and is reset to zero when the container has been running properly for at least twice this time.\nAn exponentially increasing delay is also used after each failed attempt to download a container image.\nAdding a liveness probe to a container ensures that the container is restarted when it stops responding. The liveness probe checks the state of the application via an HTTP GET request, by executing a command in the container, or opening a TCP connection to one of the network ports of the container.\nIf the application needs a long time to start, a startup probe can be defined with settings that are more forgiving than those in the liveness probe to prevent premature restarting of the container.\nYou can define lifecycle hooks for each of the pod’s main containers. A post-start hook is invoked when the container starts, whereas a pre-stop hook is invoked when the container must shut down. A lifecycle hook is configured to either send an HTTP GET request or execute a command within the container.\nIf a pre-stop hook is defined in the container and the container must terminate, the hook is invoked first. The TERM signal is then sent to the main process in the container. If the process doesn’t stop within terminationGracePeriodSeconds after the start of the termination sequence, the process is killed.\nWhen you delete a pod object, all its containers are terminated in parallel. The pod’s deletionGracePeriodSeconds is the time given to the containers to shut down. By default, it’s set to the termination grace period, but can be overridden with the kubectl delete command.\nIf shutting down a pod takes a long time, it is likely that one of the processes running in it doesn’t handle the TERM signal. Adding a TERM signal handler is a better solution than shortening the termination or deletion grace period.\n\nYou now understand everything about the operation of containers in pods. In the next chapter you’ll learn about the other important component of pods - storage volumes.\n"},"docs/Mounting_storage_volumes_into_the_Pods_containers.html":{"url":"docs/Mounting_storage_volumes_into_the_Pods_containers.html","title":"7.

Mounting storage volumes into the Pod’s containers\nThis chapter covers\n\nPersisting files across container restarts\nSharing files between containers of the same pod\nSharing files between pods\nAttaching network storage to pods\nAccessing the host node filesystem from within a pod\n\nThe previous two chapters focused on the pod’s containers, but they are only half of what a pod typically contains. They are typically accompanied by storage volumes that allow a pod’s containers to store data for the lifetime of the pod or beyond, or to share files with the other containers of the pod. This is the focus of this chapter.\n"},"docs/Introducing_volumes.html":{"url":"docs/Introducing_volumes.html","title":"7.1 Introducing volumes","keywords":"","body":"7.1 Introducing volumes\nA pod is like a small logical computer that runs a single application. This application can consist of one or more containers that run the application processes. These processes share computing resources such as CPU, RAM, network interfaces, and others. In a typical computer, the processes use the same filesystem, but this isn’t the case with containers. Instead, each container has its own isolated filesystem provided by the container image.\nWhen a container starts, the files in its filesystem are those that were added to its container image during build time. The process running in the container can then modify those files or create new ones. When the container is terminated and restarted, all changes it made to its files are lost, because the previous container is not really restarted, but completely replaced, as explained in the previous chapter. Therefore, when a containerized application is restarted, it can’t continue from the point where it was when it stopped. Although this may be okay for some types of applications, others may need the filesystem or at least part of it to be preserved on restart.\nThis is achieved by adding a volume to the pod and mounting it into the container.\nDEFINITION\nMounting is the act of attaching the filesystem of some storage device or volume into a specific location in the operating system’s file tree, as shown in figure 7.1. The contents of the volume are then available at that location.\n\nFigure 7.1 Mounting a filesystem into the file tree\n\nUnderstanding how volumes fit into pods\nLike containers, volumes aren’t top-level resources like pods or nodes, but are a component within the pod and thus share its lifecycle. As the following figure shows, a volume is defined at the pod level and then mounted at the desired location in the container.\nFigure 7.2 Volumes are defined at the pod level and mounted in the pod’s containers\n\nThe lifecycle of a volume is tied to the lifecycle of the entire pod and is independent of the lifecycle of the container in which it is mounted. Due to this fact, volumes are also used to persist data across container restarts.\nPersisting files across container restarts\nAll volumes in a pod are created when the pod is set up - before any of its containers are started. They are torn down when the pod is shut down.\nEach time a container is (re)started, the volumes that the container is configured to use are mounted in the container’s filesystem. The application running in the container can read from the volume and write to it if the volume and mount are configured to be writable.\nA typical reason for adding a volume to a pod is to persist data across container restarts. If no volume is mounted in the container, the entire filesystem of the container is ephemeral. Since a container restart replaces the entire container, its filesystem is also re-created from the container image. As a result, all files written by the application are lost.\nIf, on the other hand, the application writes data to a volume mounted inside the container, as shown in the following figure, the application process in the new container can access the same data after the container is restarted.\nFigure 7.3 Volumes ensure that part of the container’s filesystem is persisted across restarts\n\nIt is up to the author of the application to determine which files must be retained on restart. Normally you want to preserve data representing the application’s state, but you may not want to preserve files that contain the application’s locally cached data, as this prevents the container from starting fresh when it’s restarted. Starting fresh every time may allow the application to heal itself when corruption of the local cache causes it to crash. Just restarting the container and using the same corrupted files could result in an endless crash loop.\nTIP\nBefore you mount a volume in a container to preserve files across container restarts, consider how this affects the container’s self-healing capability.\n\nMounting multiple volumes in a container\nA pod can have multiple volumes and each container can mount zero or more of these volumes in different locations, as shown in the following figure.\nFigure 7.4 A pod can contain multiple volumes and a container can mount multiple volumes\n\nThe reason why you might want to mount multiple volumes in one container is that these volumes may serve different purposes and can be of different types with different performance characteristics.\nIn pods with more than one container, some volumes can be mounted in some containers but not in others. This is especially useful when a volume contains sensitive information that should only be accessible to some containers.\nSharing files between multiple containers\nA volume can be mounted in more than one container so that applications running in these containers can share files. As discussed in chapter 5, a pod can combine a main application container with sidecar containers that extend the behavior of the main application. In some cases, the containers must read or write the same files.\nFor example, you could create a pod that combines a web server running in one container with a content-producing agent running in another container. The content agent container generates the static content that the web server then delivers to its clients. Each of the two containers performs a single task that has no real value on its own. However, as the next figure shows, if you add a volume to the pod and mount it in both containers, you enable these containers to\nbecome a complete system that provides a valuable service and is more than the sum of its parts.\nFigure 7.5 A volume can be mounted into more than one container\n\nThe same volume can be mounted at different places in each container, depending on the needs of the container itself. If the content agent writes content to /var/data, it makes sense to mount the volume there. Since the web server expects the content to be in /var/html, the container running it has the volume mounted at this location.\nIn the figure you’ll also notice that the volume mount in each container can be configured either as read/write or as read-only. Because the content agent needs to write to the volume whereas the web server only reads from it, the two mounts are configured differently. In the interest of security, it’s advisable to prevent the web server from writing to the volume, since this could allow an attacker to compromise the system if the web server software has a vulnerability that allows attackers to write arbitrary files to the filesystem and execute them.\nOther examples of using a single volume in two containers are cases where a sidecar container runs a tool that processes or rotates the web server logs or when an init container creates configuration files for the main application container.\nPersisting data across pod restarts\nA volume is tied to the lifecycle of the pod and only exists for as long as the pod exists, but depending on the volume type, the files in the volume can remain intact after the pod and volume disappear and can later be mounted into a new volume.\nAs the following figure shows, a pod volume can map to persistent storage outside the pod. In this case, the file directory representing the volume isn’t a local file directory that persists data only for the duration of the pod, but is instead a mount to an existing, typically network-attached storage volume (NAS) whose lifecycle isn’t tied to any pod. The data stored in the volume is thus persistent and can be used by the application even after the pod it runs in is replaced with a new pod running on a different worker node.\nFigure 7.6 Pod volumes can also map to storage volumes that persist across pod restarts\n\nIf the pod is deleted and a new pod is created to replace it, the same network-attached storage volume can be attached to the new pod instance so that it can access the data stored there by the previous instance.\nSharing data between pods\nDepending on the technology that provides the external storage volume, the same external volume can be attached to multiple pods simultaneously, allowing them to share data. The following figure shows a scenario where three pods each define a volume that is mapped to the same external persistent storage volume.\nFigure 7.7 Using volumes to share data between pods\n\nIn the simplest case, the persistent storage volume could be a simple local directory on the worker node’s filesystem, and the three pods have volumes that map to that directory. If all three pods are running on the same node, they can share files through this directory.\nIf the persistent storage is a network-attached storage volume, the pods may be able to use it even when they are deployed to different nodes. However, this depends on whether the underlying storage technology supports attaching the network volume to more than one computer simultaneously.\nWhile technologies such as Network File System (NFS) allow attaching the volume in read/write mode on multiple computers, other technologies typically available in cloud environments, such as the Google Compute Engine Persistent Disk, allow the volume to be used either in read/write mode on a single cluster node, or in read-only mode on many nodes.\nIntroducing volume types\nWhen you add a volume to a pod, you must specify the volume type. A wide range of volume types is available. Some are generic, while others are specific to the storage technologies used underneath. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of the supported volume types:\n\nemptyDir—A simple directory that allows the pod to store data for the duration of its life cycle. The directory is created just before the pod starts and is initially empty - hence the name. The gitRepo volume, which is now deprecated, is similar, but is initialized by cloning a Git repository. Instead of using a gitRepo volume, it is recommended to use an emptyDir volume and initialize it using an init container.\nhostPath—Used for mounting files from the worker node’s filesystem into the pod. nfs—An NFS share mounted into the pod.\ngcePersistentDisk (Google Compute Engine Persistent Disk), awsElasticBlockStore (Amazon Web Services Elastic Block Store), azureFile (Microsoft Azure File Service), azureDisk (Microsoft Azure Data Disk)—Used for mounting cloud provider-specific storage.\ncephfs, cinder, fc, flexVolume, flocker, glusterfs, iscsi, portworxVolume, quobyte, rbd, scaleIO, storageos, photonPersistentDisk, vsphereVolume—Used for mounting other types of network storage.\nconfigMap, secret, downwardAPI, and the projected volume type—Special types of volumes used to expose information about the pod and other Kubernetes objects through files. They are typically used to configure the application running in the pod. You’ll learn about them in chapter 9.\npersistentVolumeClaim—A portable way to integrate external storage into pods. Instead of pointing directly to an external storage volume, this volume type points to a PersistentVolumeClaim object that points to a PersistentVolume object that finally references the actual storage. This volume type requires a separate explanation, which you’ll find in the next chapter.\ncsi—A pluggable way of adding storage via the Container Storage Interface. This volume type allows anyone to implement their own storage driver that is then referenced in the csi volume definition. During pod setup, the CSI driver is called to attach the volume to the pod.\n\nThese volume types serve different purposes. The following sections cover the most representative volume types and help you to gain a general understanding of volumes.\n"},"docs/Using_volumes.html":{"url":"docs/Using_volumes.html","title":"7.2 Using volumes","keywords":"","body":"7.2 Using volumes\nThe simplest volume type is emptyDir. This is the volume type you normally use when you need to persist files across container restarts, as explained in section 7.1.1.\nUsing an emptyDir volume to persist files across container restarts\nRemember the fortune pod from the previous chapter? It uses a post-start hook to write a fortune quote to a file that is then served by the Nginx web server. This file is stored in the container’s filesystem, which means that it’s lost whenever the container is restarted.\nYou can confirm this by deploying the pod in the fortune-no-volume.yaml file, retrieving the quote, and then restarting the container by telling Nginx to stop. The following listing shows the commands you need to run.\nListing 7.1 Testing the behavior of the fortune-no-volume pod\n$ kubectl apply -f fortune-no-volume.yaml                                  #A\npod/fortune-no-volume created                                              #A\n\n$ kubectl exec fortune-no-volume -- cat /usr/share/nginx/html/quote        #B\nQuick!! Act as if nothing has happened!                                    #B\n\n$ kubectl exec fortune-no-volume -- nginx -s stop                          #C\n[notice] 71#71: signal process started                                     #C\n\n$ kubectl exec fortune-no-volume -- cat /usr/share/nginx/html/quote        #D\nHindsight is an exact science.                                             #D\n\nWhen you retrieve the quote after restarting the container, you’ll see that it has changed. If you want the pod to serve the same quote no matter how often its container is restarted, you must ensure the file in stored in a volume. An emptyDir volume is perfect for this.\nIntroducing the emptyDir volume type\nThe emptyDir volume is the simplest type of volume. As the name suggests, it starts as an empty directory. When this type of volume is mounted in a container, files written by the application to the path where the volume is mounted are preserved for the duration of the pod’s existence.\nThis volume type is used in single-container pods when data must be preserved even if the container is restarted. It’s also used when the container’s filesystem is marked read-only and you want to make only part of it writable. In pods with two or more containers, an emptyDir volume is used to exchange data between them.\nAdding an emptyDir volume to the fortune pod\nLet’s change the definition of the fortune pod so that the post-start hook writes the file to the volume instead of to the ephemeral filesystem of the container. Two changes to the pod manifest are required to achieve this:\n\nAn emptyDir volume must be added to the pod.\nThe volume must be mounted into the container.\n\nHowever, since the post-start hook is executed every time the container is started, you also need to change the command that the post-start hook executes if you want to prevent it from overwriting the file if it already exists. The operation of the new command is explained in the sidebar.\nUNDERSTANDING THE NEW COMMAND IN THE FORTUNE POST-START HOOK\nThe post-start hook executes the following shell command:\nls /usr/share/nginx/html/quote || (apk add fortune &&\n[CA] fortune > /usr/share/nginx/html/quote)\n\nIf you’re not familiar with the Linux shell, it may not be obvious what this command does. Let me explain.\nFirst, the ls command, which is typically used to list directory contents, is used in an untypical way to check whether the quote file exists. What you may not know is that the ls command succeeds (returns exit code zero) if the specified file exists, and fails (returns a non-zero exit code) if it doesn’t.\nSince in our case the entire command is an or expression, as denoted by the double pipe character, the right side of the expression is never evaluated if the left side of the expression evaluates to true (which is when the ls command succeeds). When this happens, the apk and fortune commands are never executed. Therefore, if the quote file already exists, it’s not overwritten.\nIf the file doesn’t exist, the ls command fails, causing the left side of the expression to be false, which means that the right side must be evaluated to resolve the expression. The apk and fortune commands are therefore executed and they generate the quote file.\nThis new command ensures that the quote file is only written once - at the first start of the container, not at subsequent restarts\n\nThe following listing shows the new pod manifest that incorporates all the changes.\nListing 7.2 A pod with an emptyDir volume: fortune-emptydir.yaml\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\nname: fortune-emptydir\nspec:\nvolumes:                                                    #A\n- name: content                                             #A\nemptyDir: {}                                                #A\ncontainers:\n- name: nginx\nimage: nginx:alpine\nvolumeMounts:                                               #B\n- name: content                                             #B\nmountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html                            #B\nlifecycle:\npostStart:\nexec:\ncommand:\n- sh\n- -c\n- \"ls /usr/share/nginx/html/quote || (apk add fortune &&\" \\ #C\n\"[CA] fortune > /usr/share/nginx/html/quote)\"               #C\nports:\n- name: http\ncontainerPort: 80\n\nThe listing shows that an emptyDir volume named content is defined in the spec.volumes array of the pod manifest.\nConfiguring the volume\nIn general, each volume definition must include a name and a type, which is indicated by the name of the nested field (for example: emptyDir, gcePersistentDisk, nfs, and so on). This field is typically an object with additional sub-fields that allow you to configure the volume and are specific to each volume type.\nFor example, the emptyDir volume type supports two fields for configuring the volume. They are explained in the following table.\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmedium\nThe type of storage medium to use for the directory. If left empty, the default medium of the host node is used (the directory is created on one of the node’s disks). The only other supported option is Memory, which causes the volume to use tmpfs, a virtual memory filesystem where the files are kept in memory instead of on the hard disk.\n\n\nsizeLimit\nThe total amount of local storage required for the directory, whether on disk or in memory. For example, to set the maximum size to ten mebibytes, you set this field to 10Mi.\n\n\n\nTable 7.1 Configuration options for an emptyDir volume\nNOTE\nThe emptyDir field in the volume definition defines neither of these properties. The curly braces {} have been added to indicate this explicitly, but they can be omitted.\n\nMounting the volume in the container\nDefining a volume in the pod is only half of what you need to do to make it available in a container. The volume must also be mounted in the container. This is done by referencing the volume by name in the volumeMounts array within the container definition.\nIn addition to the name, a volume mount definition must also include the mountPath - the path within the container where the volume should be mounted. In the example, the volume is mounted at /usr/share/nginx/html because that’s where the post-start hook writes the quote file.\nSince the quote file is now written to the volume, which exists for the duration of the pod, the pod should always serve the same quote, even when the container is restarted.\nObserving the emptyDir volume in action\nIf you deploy the pod in the listing, you’ll notice that the quote will remain the same throughout the life of the pod, regardless of how often the container is restarted, because the /usr/share/nginx/html directory where the file is stored is mounted from somewhere else. You can tell this by listing the mount points in the container. Run the mount command to see that the directory is mounted into the container from elsewhere:\n$ kubectl exec fortune-emptydir -- mount --list | grep nginx/html\n/dev/mapper/fedora_t580-home on /usr/share/nginx/html type ext4 (rw)\n\nUsing an emptyDir volume to share files between containers\nAn emptyDir volume is also useful for sharing files between containers of the same pod (it can’t be used to share files between containers of different pods). Let’s see how this is done.\nThe fortune pod currently serves the same quote throughout the lifetime of the pod. This isn’t so interesting. Let’s build a new version of the pod, where the quote changes every 30 seconds.\nYou’ll retain Nginx as the web server, but will replace the post-start hook with a container that periodically runs the fortune command to update the quote stored in the file. The container is available at docker.io/luksa/fortune:1.0, but you can also build it yourself by following the instructions in the sidebar.\nBUILDING THE FORTUNE CONTAINER IMAGE\nYou need two files to build the image. First is the docker_entrypoint.sh script that has the following contents:\n#!/bin/sh\ntrap \"exit\" INT\n\nINTERVAL=${INTERVAL:-30}\nOUTPUT_FILE=${1:-/var/local/output/quote}\n\necho \"Fortune Writer 1.0\"\necho \"Configured to write fortune to $OUTPUT_FILE every $INTERVAL seconds\"\n\nwhile :\ndo\necho \"$(date) Writing fortune...\"\nfortune > $OUTPUT_FILE\nsleep $INTERVAL\ndone\n\nThis is the script that is executed when you run this container. To build the container image, you’ll also need a Dockerfile with the following contents:\nFROM alpine\nRUN apk add fortune\nCOPY docker_entrypoint.sh /docker_entrypoint.sh\nVOLUME /var/local/output\nENTRYPOINT [\"/docker_entrypoint.sh\"]\n\nYou can build the image and push it to Docker Hub by running the following two commands (replace luksa with your own Docker Hub user ID):\n$ docker build -t luksa/fortune-writer:1.0 .\n$ docker push luksa/fortune-writer:1.0\n\nIf you’ve downloaded the code from the book’s code repository at GitHub, you’ll find both files in the Chapter07/fortune-writer-image directory. To build and push the image you can also run the following command in the Chapter07/ directory:\n$ PREFIX=luksa/ PUSH=true ./build-fortune-writer-image.sh\n\nAgain, replace luksa/ with your Docker Hub user ID.\n\nCreating the pod\nNow that you have both images required to run the pod, create the pod manifest. Its contents are shown in the following listing.\nListing 7.3 Two containers sharing the same volume: fortune.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\nname: fortune\nspec:\nvolumes:\n- name: content\nemptyDir: {}\ncontainers:\n- name: fortune\nimage: luksa/fortune-writer:1.0\nvolumeMounts:\n- name: content\nmountPath: /var/local/output #C\n- name: nginx\nimage: nginx:alpine\nvolumeMounts:\n- name: content\nmountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html\nreadOnly: true\nports:\n- name: http\ncontainerPort: 80\n\nThe pod consists of two containers and a single volume, which is mounted in both containers, but at different locations within each container. The reason for this is that the fortune container writes the quote file into the /var/local/output directory, whereas the nginx container serves files from the /usr/share/nginx/html directory.\nRunning the pod\nWhen you create the pod from the manifest, the two containers start and continue running until the pod is deleted. The fortune container writes a new quote to the file every 30 seconds, and the nginx container serves this file. After you create the pod, use the kubectl port-forward command to open a communication tunnel to the pod and test if the server responds with a different quote every 30 seconds.\nAlternatively, you can also display the contents of the file using either of the following two commands:\n$ kubectl exec fortune -c fortune -- cat /var/local/output/quote\n$ kubectl exec fortune -c nginx -- cat /usr/share/nginx/html/quote\n\nAs you can see, one of them prints the contents of the file from within the fortune container, whereas the other command prints the contents from within the nginx container. Because the two paths point to the same quote file on the shared volume, the output of the commands is identical.\nSpecifying the storage medium to use in the emptyDir volume\nThe emptyDir volume in the previous example created a directory on the actual drive of the worker node hosting your pod, so its performance depends on the type of drive installed on the node. If you need to perform the I/O operations on the volume as quickly as possible, you can instruct Kubernetes to create the volume using the tmpfs filesystem, which keeps its files in memory. To do this, set the emptyDir’s medium field to Memory as in the following snippet:\nvolumes:\n  - name: content\n    emptyDir:\nmedium: Memory\n\nCreating the emptyDir volume in memory is also a good idea whenever it’s used to store sensitive data. Because the data is not written to disk, there is less chance that the data will be compromised and persisted longer than desired. As you’ll learn in chapter 9, Kubernetes uses the same in-memory approach when data stored in the Secret API object type needs to be exposed to the application in the container.\nSpecifying the size limit for the emptyDir volume\nThe size of an emptyDir volume can be limited by setting the sizeLimit field. Setting this field is especially important for in-memory volumes when the overall memory usage of the pod is limited by so-called resource limits. You’ll learn about this in chapter 20.\nSpecifying how a volume is to be mounted in the container\nIn the previous section, the focus was mainly on the volume type. The volume was mounted in the container with the minimum configuration required, as shown in the following listing.\nListing 7.4 The minimal configuration of a volumeMount\ncontainers:\n- name: my-container\n...\nvolumeMounts:\n- name: my-volume\nmountPath: /path/in/container\n\nAs you can see in the listing, the absolute minimum is to specify the name of the volume and the path where it should be mounted. But other configuration options for mounting volumes exist. The full list of volume mount options is shown in the following table.\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nname\nThe name of the volume to mount. This must match one of the volumes defined in the pod.\n\n\nmountPath\nThe path within the container at which to mount the volume.\n\n\nreadOnly\nWhether to mount the volume as read-only. Defaults to false.\n\n\nmountPropagation\nSpecifies what should happen if additional filesystem volumes are mounted inside the volume.   Defaults to None, which means that the container won’t receive any mounts that are mounted by the host, and the host won’t receive any mounts that are mounted by the container.   HostToContainer means that the container will receive all mounts that are mounted into this volume by the host, but not the other way around.   Bidirectional means that the container will receive mounts added by the host, and the host will receive mounts added by the container.\n\n\nsubPath\nDefaults to “” which means that the entire volume is mounted into the container. When set to a non-empty string, only the specified subPath within the volume is mounted into the container.\n\n\nsubPathExpr\nJust like subPath but can have environment variable references using the syntax $(ENV_VAR_NAME). Only environment variables that are explicitly defined in the container definition are applicable. Implicit variables such as HOSTNAME will not be resolved. You’ll learn how to specify environment variables in chapter 9.\n\n\n\nTable 7.2 Configuration options for a volume mount\nIn most cases, you only specify the name, mountPath and whether the mount should be readOnly. The mountPropagation option comes into play for advanced use-cases where additional mounts are added to the volume’s file tree later, either from the host or from the container. The subPath and subPathExpr options are useful when you want to use a single volume with multiple directories that you want to mount to different containers instead of using multiple volumes.\nThe subPathExpr option is also used when a volume is shared by multiple pod replicas. In chapter 9, you’ll learn how to use the Downward API to inject the name of the pod into an environment variable. By referencing this variable in subPathExpr, you can configure each replica to use its own subdirectory based on its name.\n"},"docs/Integrating_external_storage_into_pods.html":{"url":"docs/Integrating_external_storage_into_pods.html","title":"7.3 Integrating external storage into pods","keywords":"","body":"7.3 Integrating external storage into pods\nAn emptyDir volume is basically a dedicated directory created specifically for and used exclusively by the pod that contains the volume. When the pod is deleted, the volume and its contents are deleted. However, other types of volumes don’t create a new directory, but instead mount an existing external directory in the filesystem of the container. The contents of this volume can survive multiple instantiations of the same pod and can even be shared by multiple pods. These are the types of volumes we’ll explore next.\nTo learn how external storage is used in a pod, you’ll create a pod that runs the document-oriented database MongoDB. To ensure that the data stored in the database is persisted, you’ll add a volume to the pod and mount it in the container at the location where MongoDB writes its data files.\nThe tricky part of this exercise is that the type of persistent volumes available in your cluster depends on the environment in which the cluster is running. At the beginning of this book, you learned that Kubernetes can reschedule a pod to another node at will. To ensure that the MongoDB pod can still access its data, it should use some kind of network-attached storage instead of the worker node’s local drive.\nIdeally, you should use a proper Kubernetes cluster, such as GKE, for the following exercises. Unfortunately, clusters provisioned with Minikube or kind don’t provide any kind of network storage volume out of the box. So, if you’re using either of these tools, you’ll need to resort to using node-local storage provided by the so-called hostPath volume type, even though this volume type is explained later, in section 7.4.\nUsing a Google Compute Engine Persistent Disk in a pod volume\nIf you use Google Kubernetes Engine to run the exercises in this book, your cluster nodes run on Google Compute Engine (GCE). In GCE, persistent storage is provided via GCE Persistent Disks. Kubernetes supports adding the to your pods via the gcePersistentDisk volume type.\nNOTE\nTo adapt this exercise for use with other cloud providers, use the appropriate volume type supported by the cloud provider. Consult the documentation provided by the cloud provider to determine how to create the storage volume and how to mount it into the pod.\n\nCreating a GCE Persistent Disk\nBefore you can use the GCE persistent disk volume in your pod, you must create the disk itself. It must reside in the same zone as your Kubernetes cluster. If you don’t remember in which zone you created the cluster, you can see it by listing your Kubernetes clusters using the gcloud command as follows:\n$ gcloud container clusters list\nNAME   ZONE            MASTER_VERSION  MASTER_IP       ...\nkubia  europe-west3-c  1.14.10-gke.42  104.155.84.137  ...\n\nIn my case, this shows that the cluster is located in the zone europe-west3-c, so I have to create the GCE persistent disk in the same zone as well. The zone must be specified when creating the disk as follows:\n$ gcloud compute disks create --size=1GiB --zone=europe-west3-c mongodb\nWARNING: You have selected a disk size of under [200GB]. This may result in poor I/O performance. For more information, see: https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/disks#pdperformance.\nCreated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/rapid-pivot-136513/zones/europe-west3-c/disks/mongodb].\nNAME     ZONE            SIZE_GB  TYPE         STATUS\nmongodb  europe-west3-c  1        pd-standard  READY\n\nThis command creates a GCE persistent disk called mongodb with 1GiB of space. You can freely ignore the disk size warning, because it doesn’t affect the exercises you’re about to run. You may also see an additional warning that the disk is not yet formatted. You can ignore that, too, because formatting is done automatically when you use the disk in your pod.\nCreating a pod with a gcePersistentDisk volume\nNow that you have set up your physical storage, you can use it in a volume inside your MongoDB pod. You’ll create the pod from the YAML shown in the following listing.\nListing 7.5 A pod using a gcePersistentDisk volume: mongodb-pod-gcepd.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: mongodb\nspec:\nvolumes:\n  - name: mongodb-data\n    gcePersistentDisk:\n      pdName: mongodb\n      fsType: ext4\n  containers:\n  - image: mongo\n    name: mongodb\n    volumeMounts:\n    - name: mongodb-data\n      mountPath: /data/db\n    ports:\n    - containerPort: 27017\n      protocol: TCP\n\nNOTE \nIf you’re using Minikube or kind, you can’t use a GCE Persistent Disk, but you can deploy mongodb-pod-hostpath.yaml, which uses a hostPath volume instead of a GCE PD. This uses node-local instead of network storage, so you must ensure that the pod is always deployed to the same node. This is always true in Minikube because it creates a single node cluster. If you’re using kind, create the pod from the file mongodb-pod-hostpath-kind.yaml, which ensures that the pod is always deployed on the same node.\n\nThe pod is visualized in the following figure. It consists of a single container and a single volume backed by the GCE Persistent Disk you created earlier. Within the container, the volume is mounted at /data/db, since this is the place where MongoDB stores its data. This ensures that the data will be written to the persistent disk.\nFigure 7.8 A GCE Persistent Disk used as a pod Volume and mounted into one of its containers\n\nWriting to the volume\nAfter you create the pod, run the MongoDB client inside the container and add some data to the database. To do this, run the client as shown in the following listing.\nListing 7.6 Entering the MongoDB shell inside the mongodb pod\n$ kubectl exec -it mongodb -- mongo\nMongoDB shell version v4.4.0\nconnecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/...\nImplicit session: session { \"id\" : UUID(\"42671520-0cf7-...\") }\nMongoDB server version: 4.4.0\n...\n>\n\nTo insert a document into the database, enter the following commands:\n> use mystore\nswitched to db mystore\n> db.foo.insert({name:'foo'})\nWriteResult({ \"nInserted\" : 1 })\n\nThis inserts a document with a single property called name. You can also specify additional properties in the document if you wish, or add additional documents. Now, use the find() command to retrieve the document you inserted:\n> db.foo.find()\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"57a61eb9de0cfd512374cc75\"), \"name\" : \"foo\" }\n\nThis document should now be stored in MongoDB’s data files, which are located in the /data/db directory. Since this is where you mounted the GCE Persistent Disk, the document should be stored permanently.\nRe-creating the pod and verifying that it can read the data persisted by the previous pod\nYou can now exit the mongodb client (type exit and press Enter), after which you can delete the pod and recreate it:\n$ kubectl delete pod mongodb\npod \"mongodb\" deleted\n$ kubectl create -f mongodb-pod-gcepd.yaml\npod \"mongodb\" created\n\nSince the new pod is an exact replica of the previous, it points to the same GCE persistent disk as the previous pod, so the MongoDB container running inside it should see the exact same files, even if the new pod is scheduled to another node.\nTIP \nYou can see what node a pod is scheduled to by running kubectl get po -o wide.\n\nOnce the container starts up, you can run the MongoDB client again and check if the previously stored document(s) can still be retrieved, as shown in the following listing.\nListing 7.7 Retrieving MongoDB’s persisted data in a new pod\n$ kubectl exec -it mongodb mongo\n...\n> use mystore\nswitched to db mystore\n> db.foo.find()\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"57a61eb9de0cfd512374cc75\"), \"name\" : \"foo\" }\n\nAs expected, the data still exists even though you deleted and recreated the pod. This confirms that you can use a GCE persistent disk to persist data across multiple instantiations of the same pod. To be more precise, it isn’t the same pod. They are two different pods pointing to the same underlying persistent storage.\nYou might wonder if you can use the same persistent disk in two or more pods at the same time. The answer to this question is not trivial, because it requires that you understand exactly how external volumes are mounted in pods. I’ll explain this in section 7.3.3. Before I do, I need to explain how to mount external storage when your cluster isn’t running on Google’s infrastructure.\nUsing other persistent volume types\nIn the previous exercise, I explained how to add persistent storage to a pod running in Google Kubernetes Engine. If you are running your cluster elsewhere, you should use whatever volume type is supported by the underlying infrastructure.\nFor example, if your Kubernetes cluster runs on Amazon’s AWS EC2, you can use an awsElasticBlockStore volume. If your cluster runs on Microsoft Azure, you can use the azureFile or the azureDisk volume. I won’t go into detail about how to do this, but it’s practically the same as in the previous example. You first need to create the actual underlying storage and then set the right fields in the volume definition.\nUsing an AWS Elastic Block Store volume\nFor example, if you want to use an AWS elastic block store volume instead of the GCE Persistent Disk, you only need to change the volume definition as shown in the following listing.\nListing 7.8 A pod using an awsElasticBlockStore volume: mongodb-pod-aws.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: mongodb\nspec:\nvolumes:\n  - name: mongodb-data\n    awsElasticBlockStore:\n      volumeId: mongodb\n      fsType: ext4\n  containers:\n  - ...\n\nUsing an NFS volume\nIf your cluster runs on your own servers, you have a range of other supported options for adding external storage to your pods. For example, to mount a simple NFS share, you only need to specify the NFS server and the path exported by the server, as shown in the following listing.\nListing 7.9 A pod using an nfs volume: mongodb-pod-nfs.yaml\nvolumes:\n  - name: mongodb-data\n    nfs:\n      server: 1.2.3.4\n      path: /some/path\n\nNOTE\nAlthough Kubernetes supports nfs volumes, the operating system running on the worker nodes provisioned by Minikube or kind might not support mounting nfs volumes.\n\nUsing other storage technologies\nOther supported options are iscsi for mounting an ISCSI disk resource, glusterfs for a GlusterFS mount, rbd for a RADOS Block Device, flexVolume, cinder, cephfs, flocker, fc (Fibre Channel), and others. You don’t need to understand all these technologies. They’re mentioned here to show you that Kubernetes supports a wide range of these technologies, and you can use the technologies that are available in your environment or that you prefer.\nFor details on what properties you need to set for each of these volume types, you can either refer to the Kubernetes API definitions in the Kubernetes API reference or look up the information by running kubectl explain pod.spec.volumes. If you’re already familiar with a particular storage technology, you should be able to use the explain command to easily find out how to configure the correct volume type.\nWhy does Kubernetes force software developers to understand low-level storage?\nIf you’re a software developer and not a system administrator, you might wonder if you really need to know all this low-level information about storage volumes? As a developer, should you have to deal with infrastructure-related storage details when writing the pod definition, or should this be left to the cluster administrator?\nAt the beginning of this book, I explained that Kubernetes abstracts away the underlying infrastructure. The configuration of storage volumes explained earlier clearly contradicts this. Furthermore, including infrastructure-related information, such as the NFS server hostname directly in a pod manifest means that this manifest is tied to this particular Kubernetes cluster. You can’t use the same manifest without modification to deploy the pod in another cluster.\nFortunately, Kubernetes offers another way to add external storage to your pods. One that divides the responsibility for configuring and using the external storage volume into two parts. The low-level part is managed by cluster administrators, while software developers only specify the high-level storage requirements for their applications. Kubernetes then connects the two parts.\nYou’ll learn about this in the next chapter, but first you need a basic understanding of pod volumes. You’ve already learned most of it, but I still need to explain some details.\nUnderstanding how external volumes are mounted\nTo understand the limitations of using external volumes in your pods, whether a pod references the volume directly or indirectly, as explained in the next chapter, you must be aware of the caveats associated with the way network storage volumes are actually attached to the pods.\nLet’s return to the issue of using the same network storage volume in multiple pods at the same time. What happens if you create a second pod and point it to the same GCE Persistent Disk?\nI’ve prepared a manifest for a second MongoDB pod that uses the same GCE Persistent Disk. The manifest can be found in the file mongodb2-pod-gcepd.yaml. If you use it to create the second pod, you’ll notice that it never runs. Even after a few minutes, its status is still shown as ContainerCreating:\n$ kubectl get po\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE\nmongodb 1/1 Running 0 10m\nmongodb2 0/1 ContainerCreating 0 2m15s\n\nYou can see why this is the case with the kubectl describe command. At the very bottom, you see a FailedAttachVolume event generated by the attachdetach-controller. The event has the following message:\nAttachVolume.Attach failed for volume \"mongodb-data\" : googleapi: Error 400: RESOURCE_IN_USE_BY_ANOTHER_RESOURCE - The disk resource 'projects/-xyz/zones/europe-west3-c/disks/mongodb' is already being used by 'projects/ xyz/zones/europe-west3-c/instances/gke-kubia-default-pool-xyz-1b27'\n\nThe message indicates that the node hosting the mongodb2 pod can’t attach the external volume because it’s already in use by another node. If you check where the two pods are scheduled, you’ll see that they are not on the same node:\n$ kubectl get po -o wide\nNAME READY STATUS ... NODE\nmongodb 1/1 Running ... gke-kubia-default-pool-xyz-1b27\nmongodb2 0/1 ContainerCreating ... gke-kubia-default-pool-xyz-gqbj\n\nThe mongodb pod is running on node 1b27, while the mongodb2 pod is scheduled to node gqbj. As is typically the case in cloud environments, you can’t mount the same GCE Persistent Disk on multiple hosts simultaneously in read/write mode. You can only mount it on multiple hosts in read-only mode.\nInterestingly, the error message doesn’t say that the disk is being used by the mongodb pod, but by the node hosting the pod. And this is a very important detail about how external volumes are mounted into pods.\nAs the following figure shows, a network volume is mounted by the host node, and then the pod is given access to the mount point. Typically, the underlying storage technology doesn’t allow a volume to be attached to more than one node at a time in read/write mode, but multiple pods on the same node can all use the volume in read/write mode.\nFigure 7.9 Network volumes are mounted by the host node and then exposed in pods\n\nFor most storage technologies available in the cloud, the only way to use the same network volume on multiple nodes simultaneously is to mount them in read-only mode. For example, pods scheduled to different nodes can use the same GCE Persistent Disk if it is mounted in read-only mode, as shown in the next listing:\nListing 7.10 Mounting a GCE Persistent Disk in read-only mode\nkind: Pod\nspec:\nvolumes:\n- name: my-volume\ngcePersistentDisk:\npdName: my-volume\nfsType: ext4\nreadOnly: true\n\nIt is important to consider this network storage limitation when designing the architecture of your distributed application. Replicas of the same pod typically can’t use the same network volume in read/write mode. Fortunately, Kubernetes takes care of this, too. In chapter 13, you’ll learn how to deploy stateful applications, where each pod instance gets its own network storage volume.\nYou’re now done playing with the MongoDB pods, so delete them both, but hold off on deleting the underlying GCE persistent disk. You’ll use it again in the next chapter.\n"},"docs/Accessing_files_on_the_worker_nodes_filesystem.html":{"url":"docs/Accessing_files_on_the_worker_nodes_filesystem.html","title":"7.4 Accessing files on the worker node’s filesystem","keywords":"","body":"7.4 Accessing files on the worker node’s filesystem\nMost pods shouldn’t care which host node they are running on, and they shouldn’t access any files on the node’s filesystem. System-level pods are the exception. They may need to read the node’s files or use the node’s filesystem to access the node’s devices or other components via the filesystem. Kubernetes makes this possible through the hostPath volume type. I already mentioned it in the previous section, but this is where you’ll learn when to actually use it.\nIntroducing the hostPath volume\nA hostPath volume points to a specific file or directory in the filesystem of the host node, as shown in the next figure. Pods running on the same node and using the same path in their hostPath volume see the same files.\nFigure 7.10 A hostPath volume mounts a file or directory from the worker node’s filesystem into the container.\n\nA hostPath volume is not a good place to store the data of a database. Because the contents of the volume are stored on the filesystem of a specific node, the database pod will not be able to see the data if it gets rescheduled to another node.\nTypically, a hostPath volume is used in cases where the pod actually needs to read or write files written or read by the node itself, such as system-level logs.\nThe hostPath volume type is one of the most dangerous volume types in Kubernetes and is usually reserved for use in privileged pods only. If you allow unrestricted use of the hostPath volume, users of the cluster can do anything they want on the node. For example, they can use it to mount the Docker socket file (typically /var/run/docker.sock) in their container and then run the Docker client within the container to run any command on the host node as the root user. You’ll learn how to prevent this in chapter 24.\nUsing a hostPath volume\nTo demonstrate how dangerous hostPath volumes are, let’s deploy a pod that allows you to explore the entire filesystem of the host node from within the pod. The pod manifest is shown in the following listing.\nListing 7.11 Using a hostPath volume to gain access to the host node’s filesystem\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\nname: node-explorer\nspec:\nvolumes:\n- name: host-root\nhostPath:\npath: /\ncontainers:\n- name: node-explorer\nimage: alpine\ncommand: [\"sleep\", \"9999999999\"]\nvolumeMounts:\n- name: host-root\nmountPath: /host\n\nAs you can see in the listing, a hostPath volume must specify the path on the host that it wants to mount. The volume in the listing will point to the root directory on the node’s filesystem, providing access to the entire filesystem of the node the pod is scheduled to.\nAfter creating the pod from this manifest using kubectl apply, run a shell in the pod with the following command:\n$ kubectl exec -it node-explorer -- sh\n\nYou can now navigate to the root directory of the node’s filesystem by running the following command:\n/ # cd /host\n\nFrom here, you can explore the files on the host node. Since the container and the shell command are running as root, you can modify any file on the worker node. Be careful not to break anything.\nNow imagine you’re an attacker that has gained access to the Kubernetes API and are able to deploy this type of pod in a production cluster. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, Kubernetes doesn’t prevent regular users from using hostPath volumes in their pods and is therefore totally unsecure. As already mentioned, you’ll learn how to secure the cluster from this type of attack in chapter 24.\nSpecifying the type for a hostPath volume\nIn the previous example, you only specified the path for the hostPath volume, but you can also specify the type to ensure that the path represents what that the process in the container expects (a file, a directory, or something else).\nThe following table explains the supported hostPath types:\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\nKubernetes performs no checks before it mounts the volume.\n\n\nDirectory\nKubernetes checks if a directory exists at the specified path. You use this type if you want to mount a pre-existing directory into the pod and want to prevent the pod from running if the directory doesn’t exist.\n\n\nDirectoryOrCreate\nSame as Directory, but if nothing exists at the specified path, an empty directory is created.\n\n\nFile\nThe specified path must be a file.\n\n\nFileOrCreate\nSame as File, but if nothing exists at the specified path, an empty file is created.\n\n\nBlockDevice\nThe specified path must be a block device.\n\n\nCharDevice\nThe specified path must be a character device.\n\n\nSocket\nThe specified path must be a UNIX socket.\n\n\n\nTable 7.3 Supported hostPath volume types\nIf the specified path doesn’t match the type, the pod’s containers don’t run. The pod’s events explain why the hostPath type check failed.\nNOTE\nWhen the type is FileOrCreate or DirectoryOrCreate and Kubernetes needs to create the file/directory, its file permissions are set to 644 (rw-r--r--) and 755 (rwxr-xr-x), respectively. In either case, the file/directory is owned by the user and group used to run the Kubelet.\n\n"},"docs/Summary_7.html":{"url":"docs/Summary_7.html","title":"7.5 Summary","keywords":"","body":"7.5 Summary\nThis chapter has explained the basics of adding volumes to pods, but this was only the beginning. You’ll learn more about this topic in the next chapter. So far you’ve learned this:\n\nPods consist of containers and volumes. Each volume can be mounted at the desired location in the container’s filesystem.\nVolumes are used to persist data across container restarts, share data between the containers in the pod, and even share data between the pods.\nMany volume types exist. Some are generic and can be used in any cluster regardless of the cluster environment, while others, such as the gcePersistentDisk, can only be used if the cluster runs on a particular cloud provider infrastructure.\nAn emptyDir volume is used to store data for the duration of the pod. It starts as an empty directory just before the pod’s containers are started and is deleted when the pod terminates.\nThe gitRepo volume is a deprecated volume type that is initialized by cloning a Git repository. Alternatively, an emptyDir volume can be used in combination with an init container that initializes the volume from Git or any other source.\nNetwork volumes are typically mounted by the host node and then exposed to the pod(s) on that node.\nDepending on the underlying storage technology, you may or may not be able to mount a network storage volume in read/write mode on multiple nodes simultaneously.\nBy using a proprietary volume type in a pod manifest, the pod manifest is tied to a specific Kubernetes cluster. The manifest must be modified before it can be used in another cluster. Chapter 8 explains how to avoid this issue.\nThe hostPath volume allows a pod to access any path in filesystem of the worker node. This volume type is dangerous because it allows users to make changes to the configuration of the worker node and run any process they want on the node.\n\nIn the next chapter, you’ll learn how to abstract the underlying storage technology away from the pod manifest and make the manifest portable to any other Kubernetes cluster.\n"},"docs/Persisting_application_data_with_PersistentVolumes.html":{"url":"docs/Persisting_application_data_with_PersistentVolumes.html","title":"8.

Persisting application data with PersistentVolumes\nThis chapter covers\n\nUsing PersistentVolume objects to represent persistent storage\nClaiming persistent volumes with PersistentVolumeClaim objects\nDynamic provisioning of persistent volumes\nUsing node-local persistent storage\n\nThe previous chapter taught you how to mount a network storage volume into your pods. However, the experience was not ideal because you needed to understand the environment your cluster was running in to know what type of volume to add to your pod. For example, if your cluster runs on Google’s infrastructure, you must define a gcePersistentDisk volume in your pod manifest. You can’t use the same manifest to run your application on Amazon because GCE Persistent Disks aren’t supported in their environment. To make the manifest compatible with Amazon, one must modify the volume definition in the manifest before deploying the pod.\nYou may remember from chapter 1 how Kubernetes is supposed to standardize application deployment between cloud providers, but using proprietary storage volume types in pod manifests goes against this.\nFortunately, there is a better way to add persistent storage to your pods. One where you don’t refer to a specific storage technology within the pod. This chapter explains this improved approach.\n"},"docs/Decoupling_pods_from_the_underlying_storage_technology.html":{"url":"docs/Decoupling_pods_from_the_underlying_storage_technology.html","title":"8.1 Decoupling pods from the underlying storage technology","keywords":"","body":"8.1 Decoupling pods from the underlying storage technology\nIdeally, a developer who deploys their applications on Kubernetes shouldn’t need to know what storage technology the cluster provides, just as they don’t need to know the characteristics of the physical servers used to run the pods. Details of the infrastructure should be handled by the people who run the cluster.\nFor this reason, when you deploy an application to Kubernetes, you typically don’t refer directly to the external storage in the pod manifest, but use an indirect approach where the storage is configured in a PersistentVolume object, as shown in the following figure. This allows the pod manifest to remain free of infrastructure-specific information.\nFigure 8.1 Decoupling pods from the underlying storage technology using PersistentVolume objects\n\nIntroducing persistent volumes and claims\nIn the previous chapter, one of the examples shows how to use an NFS file share in a pod. The volume definition in the pod manifest contains the IP address of the NFS server and the file path exported by that server. This ties the pod definition to a specific cluster and prevents it from being used elsewhere.\nAs illustrated in the following figure, if you were to deploy this pod to a different cluster, you would typically need to change at least the NFS server IP. This means that the pod definition isn’t portable across clusters. It must be modified each time you deploy it in a new Kubernetes cluster.\nFigure 8.2 A pod manifest with infrastructure-specific volume information is not portable to other clusters\n\nIntroducing persistent volumes\nTo make this pod definition portable, you must extract the environment-specific information into a PersistentVolume object. As the name suggests, a PersistentVolume object represents a storage volume available in the cluster that can be used to persist application data. As shown in the following figure, the PersistentVolume object allows the information about the underlying storage to be decoupled from the pod.\nFigure 8.3 A PersistentVolume object represents a data storage volume for persisting application data\n\nBecause the pod manifest no longer contains infrastructure-specific information, it can be used to deploy pods in different clusters. Of course, each cluster must now contain a PersistentVolume object with this information. I agree that this approach doesn’t seem to solve anything, since we’ve only moved information into a separate object, but you’ll see later that this new approach enables things that weren’t possible before.\nIntroducing persistent volume claims\nOne might think that a pod refer directly to a PersistentVolume object, but this isn’t the case. As shown in the following figure, a pod transitively references a persistent volume and its underlying storage by referring to a PersistentVolumeClaim object that references the PersistentVolume object, which then references the underlying storage. This allows the ownership of the persistent volume to be decoupled from the lifecycle of the pod.\nFigure 8.4 The relationship between the pod, persistent volume and claim, and the underlying storage\n\nAs its name suggests, a PersistentVolumeClaim object represents a user’s claim on the persistent volume. Before a user can use a persistent volume in their pods, they must first claim the volume. After claiming the volume, the user has exclusive rights to it and can use it in their pods. When the volume is no longer needed, the user releases it by deleting the PersistentVolumeClaim object.\nUsing a persistent volume claim in a pod\nTo use the persistent volume in a pod, you simply reference the persistent volume claim bound to the volume in your pod definition by name.\nFor example, if you create a persistent volume claim that gets bound to a persistent volume that represents an NFS file share, you can attach the NFS file share to your pod by adding a volume definition that points to the PersistentVolumeClaim object. The volume definition in the pod manifest only needs to contain the name of the persistent volume claim and no infrastructure-specific information, such as the IP address of the NFS server.\nAs the following figure shows, when this pod is scheduled to a worker node, Kubernetes finds the PersistentVolume object the claim referenced by the pod is bound to and uses the information in the PersistentVolume object to mount the NFS file share in the pod’s container.\nFigure 8.5 Mounting a persistent volume into the pod’s container(s)\n\nThis system with three objects is clearly more complex than what we had in the previous chapter, where the pod simply referred to the NFS File Share directly. Why is this approach better? You’ll find out in the next section.\nUnderstanding the benefits of using persistent volumes and claims\nThe biggest advantage of using persistent volumes and claims is that the infrastructure-specific details are now decoupled from the application represented by the pod. Cluster administrators, who know the data center better than anyone else, can create the PersistentVolume objects with all their infrastructure-related low-level details, while software developers focus solely on describing the applications and their needs via the Pod and PersistentVolumeClaim objects.\nThe following figure shows how the two user roles and the objects they create fit together.\nFigure 8.6 Persistent volumes are provisioned by cluster admins and consumed by pods through persistent volume claims.\n\nInstead of the developer adding a technology-specific volume to their pod, the cluster administrator sets up the underlying storage and then registers it in Kubernetes by creating a PersistentVolume object through the Kubernetes API.\nWhen a cluster user needs persistent storage in one of their pods, they first create a PersistentVolumeClaim object in which they either refer to a specific persistent volume by name, or specify the minimum volume size and access mode required by the application, and let Kubernetes find a persistent volume that meets these requirements. In both cases, the persistent volume is then bound to the claim and is given exclusive access. The claim can then be referenced in a volume definition within one or more pods. When the pod runs, the storage volume configured in the PersistentVolume object is attached to the worker node and mounted into the pod’s containers.\nIt’s important to understand that the application developer can create the manifests for the Pod and the PersistentVolumeClaim objects without knowing anything about the infrastructure on which the application will run. Similarly, the cluster administrator can provision a set of storage volumes of varying sizes in advance without knowing much about the applications that will use them.\nFurthermore, by using dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes, as discussed later in this chapter, administrators don’t need to pre-provision volumes at all. If an automated volume provisioner is installed in the cluster, the physical storage volume and the PersistentVolume object are created on demand for each PersistentVolumeClaim object that users create.\n"},"docs/Creating_persistent_volumes_and_claims.html":{"url":"docs/Creating_persistent_volumes_and_claims.html","title":"8.2 Creating persistent volumes and claims","keywords":"","body":"8.2 Creating persistent volumes and claims\nNow that you have a basic understanding of persistent volumes and claims and their relationship to the pods, let’s revisit the MongoDB pod with the GCE Persistent Disk volume from the previous chapter and reconfigure it to use a persistent volume.\nAs explained earlier, there are usually two different types of Kubernetes users involved in the provisioning and use of persistent volumes. In the following exercises, you will first take on the role of the cluster administrator to create the persistent volume. Then you’ll take on the role of a regular user to create the claim and deploy the pod.\nCreating a PersistentVolume object\nIf you use Google Kubernetes Engine to run these examples, you’ll create a persistent volume that points to a GCE Persistent Disk. You can use the GCE PD that you provisioned in the previous chapter.\nNOTE\nIf you use a different cloud provider, consult the provider’s documentation to learn how to create the physical volume in their environment. If you use Minikube, kind, or any other type of cluster, you don’t need to create volumes because you’ll use a persistent volume that refers to a local directory on the worker node.\n\nCreating a persistent volume with GCE Persistent Disk as the underlying storage\nAfter you set up the physical volume, you can create a manifest file for the PersistentVolume object, as shown in the following listing.\nListing 8.2 A persistent volume pointing to a GCE PD: mongodb-pv-gcepd.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolume\nmetadata:\n  name: mongodb-pv               #A\nspec:\n  capacity:                      #B\n    storage: 1Gi                 #B\n  accessModes:                   #C\n  - ReadWriteOnce                #C\n  - ReadOnlyMany                 #C\n  gcePersistentDisk:             #D\n    pdName: mongodb              #D\n    fsType: ext4                 #D\n\n#A The name of this persistent volume\n#B The storage capacity of this volume\n#C Whether a single node or many nodes can access this volume in read/write or read-only mode.\n#D This persistent volume uses the GCE Persistent Disk created in the previous chapter\nThe spec section in a PersistentVolume object specifies the storage capacity of the volume, the access modes it supports, and the underlying storage technology it uses, along with all the information required to use the underlying storage. In the case of GCE Persistent Disks, this includes the name of the PD resource in Google Compute Engine, the filesystem type, the name of the partition in the volume, and more.\nCreating persistent volumes backed by other storage technologies\nIf your Kubernetes cluster runs on a different cloud provider, you should be able to easily change the persistent volume manifest to use something other than a GCE PD volume, as you did in the previous chapter when you directly referenced the volume within the pod manifest.\nIf you use Minikube, kind or any other type of cluster, you can create a persistent volume that uses a local directory on the worker node instead of network storage by using the hostPath field in the PersistentVolume manifest, as shown in the following listing.\nListing 8.3 A persistent volume using a local directory: mongodb-pv-hostpath.yaml\napiVersion: v1                 #A\nkind: PersistentVolume         #A\nmetadata:                      #A\n  name: mongodb-pv             #A\nspec:                          #A\n  capacity:                    #A\n    storage: 1Gi               #A\n  accessModes:                 #A\n  - ReadWriteOnce              #A\n  - ReadOnlyMany               #A\n  hostPath:                    #B\n    path: /tmp/mongodb         #B\n\n#A These lines are identical to the GCE PD example from the previous listing\n#B Instead of a GCE Persistent Disk, this persistent volume uses a local directory on the host node to store files\nYou’ll notice that the two persistent volume manifests in this and the previous listing differ only in the part that specifies which underlying storage method to use.\nNOTE\nTo list all other supported technologies that you can use in a persistent volume, run kubectl explain pv.spec. You can then drill further down to see the individual configuration options for each technology. For example, for GCE Persistent Disks, run kubectl explain pv.spec.gcePersistentDisk.\n\nI will not bore you with the details of how to configure the persistent volume for each available storage technology, but I do need to explain the capacity and accessModes fields that you must set in each persistent volume.\nSpecifying the volume capacity\nThe capacity of the volume is self-explanatory. It indicates the size of the underlying volume. Each persistent volume must specify its capacity so that Kubernetes can determine whether a particular persistent volume can meet the requirements specified in the persistent volume claim before it can bind them.\nSpecifying volume access modes\nEach persistent volume must specify a list of accessModes it supports. Depending on the underlying technology, a persistent volume may or may not be mounted by multiple worker nodes simultaneously in read/write or read-only mode. Kubernetes inspects the persistent volume’s access modes to determine if it meets the requirements of the claim.\nNOTE\nThe access mode determines how many nodes, not pods, can attach the volume at a time. Even if a volume can only be attached to a single node, it can be mounted in many pods if they all run on that single node.\n\nThree access modes exist. They are explained in the following table along with their abbreviated form displayed by kubectl.\n\n\n\nAccess Mode\nAbbr.\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nReadWriteOnce\nRWO\nThe volume can be mounted by a single worker node in read/write mode. While it’s mounted to the node, other nodes can’t mount the volume.\n\n\nReadOnlyMany\nROX\nThe volume can be mounted on multiple worker nodes simultaneously in read-only mode.\n\n\nReadWriteMany\nRWX\nThe volume can be mounted in read/write mode on multiple worker nodes at the same time.\n\n\n\nTable 8.1 Persistent volume access modes\nNOTE\nThe ReadOnlyOnce option doesn’t exist. If you use a ReadWriteOnce volume in a pod that doesn’t need to write to it, you can mount the volume in read-only mode.\n\nUsing persistent volumes as block devices\nA typical application uses persistent volumes with a formatted filesystem. However, a persistent volume can also be configured so that the application can directly access the underlying block device without using a filesystem. This is configured on the PersistentVolume object using the spec.volumeMode field. The supported values for the field are explained in the next table.\n| Volume Mode | Description |\n| Filesystem | When the persistent volume is mounted in a container, it is mounted to a directory in the file tree of the container. If the underlying storage is an unformatted block device, Kubernetes formats the device using the filesystem specified in the volume definition (for example, in the field gcePersistentDisk.fsType) before it is mounted in the container. This is the default volume mode. |\n| Block | When a pod uses a persistent volume with this mode, the volume is made available to the application in the container as a raw block device (without a filesystem). This allows the application to read and write data without any filesystem overhead. This mode is typically used by special types of applications, such as database systems. |\nTable 8.2 Configuring the volume mode for the persistent volume\nThe manifest in listing 8.3 that you you’ll use to create your persistent volume for MongoDB does not specify a volumeMode field, which means that the default mode is used, namely Filesystem.\nCreating and inspecting the persistent volume\nYou can now create the PersistentVolume object by posting the manifest to the Kubernetes API using the now well-known command kubectl apply. Then use the kubectl get command to list the persistent volumes in your cluster:\n$ kubectl get pv\nNAME         CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES  ...  STATUS      CLAIM   ...  AGE\nmongodb-pv   1Gi        RWO,ROX       ...  Available           ...  3m\n\nNOTE \nThe shorthand for PersistentVolume is pv.\n\nThe STATUS column indicates that the persistent volume is Available. This is expected because the persistent volume isn’t yet bound to a persistent volume claim, as indicated by the empty CLAIM column. Also displayed are the volume’s capacity and the access modes, which are shown in abbreviated form, as explained in table 8.1.\nThe underlying storage technology used by the persistent volume isn’t displayed by the kubectl get pv command because it’s less important. What is important is that each persistent volume represents a certain amount of storage space available in the cluster that applications can access with the specified modes. The technology and the other parameters configured in each persistent volume are implementation details that typically don’t interest users who deploy applications. If someone needs to see these details, they can either use kubectl describe or print the full definition of the PersistentVolume object using the following command:\n$ kubectl get pv mongodb-pv -o yaml\n\nYour cluster now contains a single persistent volume. Before you can use it in your pod, you need to claim it. Let’s see how.\nClaiming a persistent volume\nIn the previous chapter you deployed a MongoDB pod that directly referenced a GCE Persistent Disk. Now you want to deploy a pod that uses the same GCE Persistent Disk through the PersistentVolume object that you created in the previous section. To do this, you must first claim the persistent volume.\nCreating a PersistentVolumeClaim object\nTo claim a persistent volume, you create a PersistentVolumeClaim object in which you specify the requirements that the persistent volume must meet. These include at least the minimum capacity of the volume and the required access modes. This is usually dictated by the application that will use the volume. For this reason, persistent volume claims should be created by the author of the application and not by cluster administrators. So, it’s time to take off your administrator hat and put on your developer hat.\nTIP\nAs an application developer, you should never include persistent volume definitions in your application manifests. You should include persistent volume claims because they specify the storage requirements of your application.\n\nTo create a PersistentVolumeClaim object, create a manifest file with the contents shown in the following listing.\nListing 8.4 A PersistentVolumeClaim object manifest: mongodb-pvc.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: mongodb-pvc          #A\nspec:\n  resources:\n    requests:                #B\n      storage: 1Gi           #B\n  accessModes:               #C\n  - ReadWriteOnce            #C\n  storageClassName: \"\"       #D\n\n#A The name of this claim. The pod will reference the claim using this name.\n#B The volume must provide at least 1 GiB of storage space.\n#C The volume must support mounting by a single node for both reading and writing.\n#D Must be set to empty string to disable dynamic provisioning.\nThe persistent volume claim defined in the listing requests that the volume that Kubernetes binds to it is at least 1GiB in size and can be mounted on a single node in read/write mode. The field storageClassName is used for dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes. It must be set to an empty string if you want Kubernetes to bind the pre-provisioned persistent volume to this claim instead of dynamically provisioning a new persistent volume.\nNOTE\nLike persistent volumes, claims can also specify the required volumeMode. As you learned in section 8.2.1, this can be either Filesystem or Block. If left unspecified, it defaults to Filesystem. When Kubernetes checks whether a volume can satisfy the claim, the volumeMode of the claim and the volume are also considered.\n\nTo create the PersistentVolumeClaim object, apply the manifest file with kubectl apply. Kubernetes then goes into action and checks the list of available persistent volumes, finds one that can provide enough storage space and the correct access mode for this claim, and binds the volume to the claim. Your claim requires 1GiB of disk space and the ReadWriteOnce access mode. The persistent volume mongodb-pv that you created earlier meets both requirements, which allows it to be bound to the claim.\nNOTE\nYou can also instruct Kubernetes to bind the claim to a specific persistent volume by specifying its name in the claim’s spec.volumeName field.\n\nListing persistent volume claims\nIf all goes well, your claim should now be bound to the mongodb-pv persistent volume. Use the kubectl get command to see if this is the case:\n$ kubectl get pvc\nNAME          STATUS   VOLUME       CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   ...\nmongodb-pvc   Bound    mongodb-pv   10Gi       RWO,ROX        ...\n\nNOTE \nWe’re using pvc as a shorthand for persistentvolumeclaim.\n\nThe output of the kubectl command shows that the claim is now bound to your persistent volume. It also shows the capacity and access modes of this volume. Even though the claim requested only 1GiB, it has 10GiB of storage space available. Similarly, although it requested the ReadWriteOnce access mode, it is bound to a volume that supports both the ReadWriteOnce (RWO) and the ReadOnlyMany (ROX) access modes.\nIf you now put on your cluster admin hat for a moment and list the persistent volumes in your cluster, you’ll see that it too is now displayed as Bound:\n$ kubectl get pv\nNAME        CAPACITY  ACCESS MODES  ...  STATUS  CLAIM                ...\nmongodb-pv  10Gi      RWO,ROX       ...  Bound   default/mongodb-pvc  ...\n\nThis allows any cluster admin to see which claim each persistent volume is bound to. In your case, the volume is bound to the claim default/mongodb-pvc.\nNOTE\nYou may wonder what the word default means in the claim name. This is the namespace in which the PersistentVolumeClaim object is located. Namespaces allow objects to be organized into disjoint sets. You’ll learn about them in chapter 10.\n\nUsing a persistent volume in a pod\nBy claiming the persistent volume, you and your pods now have the exclusive right to use the volume. No one else can claim the same volume until you release it by deleting the PersistentVolumeClaim object. You can now safely use the volume in your pod(s).\nTo use a persistent volume in the pod, you define a volume within the pod in which you refer to the PersistentVolumeClaim object that the persistent volume is bound to, as shown in the following listing.\nListing 8.5 A pod using a PersistentVolumeClaim volume: mongodb-pod-pvc.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: mongodb\nspec:\n  volumes: \n  - name: mongodb-data              #A\n    persistentVolumeClaim:          #B\n      claimName: mongodb-pvc        #B\n  containers:\n  - image: mongo\n    name: mongodb\n    volumeMounts:                   #C\n    - name: mongodb-data            #C\n      mountPath: /data/db           #C\n\n#A The internal name of the volume (applies only within the pod)\n#B The volume points to a PersistentVolumeClaim named mongodb-pvc\n#C The volume is mounted the same way that other volumes are typically mounted\nAs you can see in the listing, you don’t define the volume as a gcePersistentDisk, awsElasticBlockStore, nfs or hostPath volume, but as a persistentVolumeClaim volume. The storage technology actually used in the persistent volume is not relevant to the application in the pod. The pod doesn’t care as long as the volume that gets mounted in its containers meets the requirements defined in the PersistentVolumeClaim object.\nThe pod in the listing uses whatever persistent volume is bound to the mongodb-pvc claim. You can now create and test this pod. If you use GKE and have configured the persistent volume to use the GCE Persistent Disk that you created in the previous chapter and that already contains MongoDB data, you should be able to retrieve the data you stored earlier by running the MongoDB shell again, as shown in the following listing.\nListing 8.6 Retrieving MongoDB’s persisted data\n$ kubectl exec -it mongodb -- mongo\nMongoDB shell version: 3.2.8\nconnecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017\nWelcome to the MongoDB shell.\n...\n> use mystore\nswitched to db mystore\n> db.foo.find()\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"57a61eb9de0cfd512374cc75\"), \"name\" : \"foo\" }\n\nIf you use an empty persistent volume, you can try storing some documents as in the previous chapter, deleting and recreating the pod, and checking if you can still retrieve the same documents in the new pod.\nReleasing and re-using persistent volumes\nWhen you no longer need your application and you delete the pod, the persistent volume is unmounted, but remains bound to the persistent volume claim. If you reference this claim in another pod, the pod gets access to the same volume and its files. For as long as the claim exists, the files in the volume are persisted.\nWhen you no longer need the files or the volume, you simply delete the claim. You might wonder if you will be able to recreate the claim and access the same volume. Let’s find out.\nReleasing a persistent volume\nLet’s delete the pod and the claim and see what happens:\n$ kubectl delete pod mongodb\npod \"mongodb\" deleted\n$ kubectl delete pvc mongodb-pvc\npersistentvolumeclaim \"mongodb-pvc\" deleted\n\nNow check the status of the persistent volume:\n$ kubectl get pv\nNAME         ...   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS     CLAIM\nmongodb-pv   ...   Retain           Released   default/mongodb-pvc\n\nThe STATUS column shows the volume as Released rather than Available, as before the claim was created. The CLAIM column still shows the mongodb-pvc claim to which it was previously bound, even if the claim no longer exists. You’ll understand why in a minute.\nAttempting to bind to a released persistent volume\nWhat happens if you create the claim again? Is the persistent volume bound to the claim so that it can be reused in a pod? Run the following commands to see if this is the case.\n$ kubectl apply -f mongodb-pvc.yaml\npersistentvolumeclaim/mongodb-pvc created\n$ kubectl get pvc\nNAME          STATUS   VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE\nmongodb-pvc   Pending                                                   13s\n\nThe claim isn’t bound to the volume and its status is displayed as Pending. When you created the claim earlier, it was immediately bound to the persistent volume, so why not bind it now?\nThe reason lies in the fact that the volume has already been used and might contain data that should be erased before someone else can claim the volume. This is also the reason why the status of the volume is Released instead of Available and why the claim name is still shown on the persistent volume, as this helps the cluster administrator to know if the data can be safely deleted.\nMaking a released persistent volume available for re-use\nTo make the volume available again, you must delete and recreate the PersistentVolume object. But will this cause the data stored in the volume to be lost?\nImagine if you had accidentally deleted the pod and the claim and caused a major loss of service. You need to restore the MongoDB service as soon as possible, with all data intact. Deleting the PersistentVolume object sounds like the last thing you should do but is actually completely safe. With a pre-provisioned persistent volume like the one at hand, deleting the object is equivalent to deleting a data pointer. The PersistentVolume object only points to a GCE Persistent Disk where the data is actually stored. If you delete and recreate the object, you end up with a new pointer to the same data. Let’s try this.\n$ kubectl delete pv mongodb-pv\npersistentvolume \"mongodb-pv\" deleted\n$ kubectl apply -f mongodb-pv-gcepd.yaml\npersistentvolume/mongodb-pv created\n$ kubectl get pv\nNAME         ...   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS      CLAIM   ...\nmongodb-pv   ...   Retain           Available           ...\n\nThe persistent volume is displayed as Available again. Let me remind you that the unbound persistent volume claim still exists in the system. Kubernetes has been waiting for a suitable volume to appear that meets the requirements specified in the claim. As you might expect, the volume you’ve just created will be bound to this claim in a few seconds. List the volumes again to confirm:\n$ kubectl get pv\nNAME         ...   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS      CLAIM                 ...\nmongodb-pv   ...   Retain           Bound       default/mongodb-pvc   ...\n\nThere it is. The persistent volume is again bound to the claim. If you now deploy and query MongoDB again, you’ll see that the data in underlying GCE Persistent Disk has not been lost.\nNOTE\nAn alternative way of making the persistent volume available again is to edit the PersistentVolume object and remove the claimRef from the spec section.\n\nConfiguring the reclaim policy on persistent volumes\nWhat happens to a persistent volume when it is released is determined by the volume’s reclaim policy. When you used the kubectl get pv command to list persistent volumes, you may have noticed that the mongodb-pv volume’s policy is Retain. This policy is configured using the field .spec.persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy within the PersistentVolume object.\nThe field can have one of the three values explained in the following table.\n| Reclaim policy | Description |\n| Retain | When the persistent volume is released (when the persistent volume claim bound to it is deleted), Kubernetes retains the volume. The cluster administrator must manually reclaim the volume. This is the default policy for manually created persistent volumes. |\n| Delete | The PersistentVolume object and the underlying storage are automatically deleted upon release. This is the default policy for dynamically provisioned persistent volumes, which are discussed in the next section. |\n| Recycle | This option is deprecated and shouldn’t be used as it may not be supported by the underlying volume plugin. This policy typically causes all files on the volume to be deleted and makes the persistent volume available again without the need to delete and recreate it. |\nTable 8.3 Persistent volume reclaim policies\nTIP \nYou can change the reclaim policy for an existing PersistentVolume at any time. If it’s set to Delete and you want to prevent data loss, change the volume’s policy to Retain before deleting the claim.\n\nWARNING\nIf a persistent volume is Released and you subsequently change its reclaim policy from Retain to Delete, the PersistentVolume object and the underlying storage will be deleted. However, if you delete the object manually, the underlying storage remains intact.\n\nUnderstanding the lifecycle of manually provisioned persistent volumes and claims\nYou used the same GCE Persistent Disk throughout the exercises in this chapter, but you created multiple PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim objects and used them in more than one pod.\nTo remember the relationship between the lifecycles of these four objects, take a close look at the following figure.\nFigure 8.7 The lifecycle of statically provisioned persistent volumes, claims and the pods that use them\n\nWhen using manually provisioned persistent volumes, the lifecycle of the underlying storage volume is completely separate from the lifecycle of the PersistentVolume object. Each time you create the object, its initial status is Available. When a PersistentVolumeClaim object appears, the persistent volume is bound to it, if it meets the requirements set forth in the claim. Until the claim is bound to the volume, it has the status Pending; then both the volume and the claim are displayed as Bound.\nAt this point, one or many pods may use the volume by referring to the claim. When each pod runs, the underlying volume is mounted in the pod’s containers. After all the pods are finished with the claim, the PersistentVolumeClaim object can be deleted.\nIf the claim is deleted, the volume’s reclaim policy determines what happens to the PersistentVolume object. It is either deleted or its status is changed to Released and the volume can’t be rebound.\nEven if the PersistentVolume object is deleted, either manually or automatically based on the reclaim policy, the underlying volume and the data it contains remain intact. They can be accessed again by creating a new PersistentVolume object that references the same underlying volume.\nNOTE\nThe sequence of events described in this section applies to the use of statically provisioned volumes that exist before the claims are created. When persistent volumes are dynamically provisioned, as described in the next section, the situation is different. Look for a similar diagram at the end of the next section.\n\n"},"docs/Dynamic_provisioning_of_persistent_volumes.html":{"url":"docs/Dynamic_provisioning_of_persistent_volumes.html","title":"8.3 Dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes","keywords":"","body":"8.3 Dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes\nSo far in this chapter you’ve seen how developers can claim pre-provisioned persistent volumes as a place for their pods to store data persistently without having to deal with the details of the underlying storage technology. However, a cluster administrator must pre-provision the physical volumes and create a PersistentVolume object for each of these volumes. Then each time the volume is bound and released, the administrator must manually delete the data on the volume and recreate the object.\nTo keep the cluster running smoothly, the administrator may need to pre-provision dozens, if not hundreds, of persistent volumes, and constantly keep track of the number of available volumes to ensure the cluster never runs out. All this manual work contradicts the basic idea of Kubernetes, which is to automate the management of large clusters. As one might expect, a better way to manage volumes exists. It’s called dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes.\nWith dynamic provisioning, instead of provisioning persistent volumes in advance (and manually), the cluster admin deploys a persistent volume provisioner to automate the just-in-time provisioning process, as shown in the following figure.\nFigure 8.8 Dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes\n\nIn contrast to static provisioning, the order in which the claim and the volume arise is reversed. When a user creates a persistent volume claim, the dynamic provisioner provisions the underlying storage and creates the PersistentVolume object for that particular claim. The two objects are then bound.\nIf your Kubernetes cluster is managed by a cloud provider, it probably already has a persistent volume provisioner configured. If you are running Kubernetes on-premises, you’ll need to deploy a custom provisioner, but this is outside the scope of this chapter. Clusters that are provisioned with Minikube or kind usually also come with a provisioner out of the box.\nIntroducing the StorageClass object\nThe persistent volume claim definition you created in the previous section specifies the minimum size and the required access modes of the volume, but it also contains a field named storageClassName, which wasn’t discussed yet.\nA Kubernetes cluster can run multiple persistent volume provisioners, and a single provisioner may support several different types of storage volumes. When creating a claim, you use the storageClassName field to specify which storage class you want.\nListing storage classes\nThe storage classes available in the cluster are represented by StorageClass API objects. You can list them with the kubectl get command:\n$ kubectl get sc\nNAME                 PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   ...\nstandard (default)   rancher.io/local-path   Delete          ...\n\nNOTE \nThe shorthand for storageclass is sc.\n\nIn many clusters, as in the example above, only one storage class called standard is configured. It’s also marked as the default, which means that this is the class that is used to provision the persistent volume when you omit the storageClassName field in your persistent volume claim definition.\nNOTE\nRemember that omitting the storageClassName field causes the default storage class to be used, whereas explicitly setting the field to \"\" disables dynamic provisioning and causes an existing volume to be selected and bound to the claim.\n\nInspecting the default storage class\nLet’s get to know the StorageClass object kind by looking at the YAML definition of the standard storage class using the kubectl get command. The output of the command is shown in the following listing.\nListing 8.7 The definition of the standard storage class in a kind-provisioned cluster\n$ kubectl get sc standard -o yaml\napiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1\nkind: StorageClass\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: \"true\"  #A\n  name: standard                                         #B\n  ...\nprovisioner: rancher.io/local-path                       #C\nreclaimPolicy: Delete                                    #D\nvolumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer                  #E\n\n#A This marks the storage class as default.\n#B The name of this storage class\n#C The name of the provisioner that gets called to provision persistent volumes of this class.\n#D The reclaim policy for persistent volumes of this class.\n#E How volumes of this class are provisioned and bound.\nNOTE\nYou’ll notice that StorageClass objects have no spec or status sections. This is because the object only contains static information. Since the object’s fields aren’t organized in the two sections, the YAML manifest may be more difficult to read. This is also confounded by the fact that fields in YAML are typically sorted in alphabetical order, which means that some fields may appear above the apiVersion, kind or metadata fields. Be careful not to overlook these.\n\nIf you look closely at the top of the listing, you’ll see that the storage class definition includes an annotation, which marks this particular storage class as the default.\nNOTE\nYou’ll learn what an object annotation is in chapter 10.\n\nAs specified in the storage class definition, each time you create a persistent volume claim that references this class, the provisioner rancher.io/local-path is called to provision the persistent volume.\nThe provisioner sets the volume’s reclaim policy to the one set in the storage class, which in the above example is Delete. As you have already learned, this means that the volume is deleted when you release it by deleting the claim.\nThe last field in the storage class definition is volumeBindingMode. It determines whether the persistent volume is created immediately or only when the first consumer appears. You’ll find out what this means later.\nStorageClass objects also support some other fields that are not shown in the above listing. You can use kubectl explain to see what these are. You’ll learn about some of them in the following sections.\nIn summary, a StorageClass object represents a class of storage that can be dynamically provisioned. As shown in the following figure, each storage class specifies what provisioner to use and the parameters that should be passed to it when provisioning the volume. The user decides which storage class to use for each of their persistent volume claims.\nFigure 8.9 The relationship between storage classes, persistent volume claims and dynamic volume provisioners\n\nDynamic provisioning using the default storage class\nYou’ve previously used a statically provisioned persistent volume for your MongoDB pod. Now you’ll use dynamic provisioning to achieve the same result, but with much less manual work.\nCreating a claim with dynamic provisioning\nTo dynamically provision a persistent volume using the storage class from the previous section, you can create a PersistentVolumeClaim object with the storageClassName field set to standard or with the field omitted altogether.\nLet’s use the latter approach, as this makes the manifest as minimal as possible. You can find the manifest in the mongodb-pvc-dynamic-default.yaml file in the book’s GitHub repository. It’s also shown in the following listing.\nListing 8.8 A minimal PVC definition using the default storage class\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: mongodb-pvc-default\nspec:                      #A\n  resources:               #A\n    requests:              #A\n      storage: 1Gi         #A\n  accessModes:             #A\n    - ReadWriteOnce        #A\n\n#A Only the minimum size and access modes are specified. The storageClassName field is not set.\nThis PersistentVolumeClaim manifest contains only the storage size request and the desired access mode, but no storageClassName field, so the default storage class is used.\nAfter you have created the claim with kubectl apply, you can see which storage class it’s using by inspecting the claim with kubectl get:\n$ kubectl get pvc mongodb-pvc-default\nNAME                 STATUS   VOLUME  CAPACITY  ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS\nmongodb-pvc-default  Pending                                   standard\n\nAs expected and as indicated in the STORAGECLASS column, the claim you just created uses the standard storage class.\nUnderstanding why a claim’s status is Pending\nDepending on where you run this example, you may find that the persistent volume claim you just created is Pending. In one of the previous sections, you learned that this happens when no persistent volume matches the claim, either because it doesn’t exist or because it’s not available for binding.\nHowever, you are now using dynamic provisioning, where the volume is to be created after you create the claim, and specifically for this claim. Is your claim pending because it takes more than a few seconds to provision the volume?\nNo, the reason for the pending status lies elsewhere. Your claim will remain in the Pending state until you create a pod that uses this claim. I’ll explain why later. For now, let’s just create the pod.\nUsing the persistent volume claim in a pod\nCreate a new pod manifest file from the mongodb pod manifest that you used earlier. Change the name of the pod to mongodb-default and the value of the claimName field to make the pod use the mongodb-pvc-default claim. You can find the resulting manifest in the mongodb-pod-pvc-default.yaml file in the book’s GitHub repository. Use it to create the pod.\nMoments after you create the pod, the status of the persistent volume claim should change to Bound, as shown here:\n$ kubectl get pvc mongodb-pvc-default\nNAME                  STATUS   VOLUME             CAPACITY   ACCESS   ...\nmongodb-pvc-default   Bound    pvc-c71fb2c2-...   1Gi        RWO      ...\n\nThis implies that the persistent volume has been created. List persistent volumes to confirm (the following output has been reformatted to make it easier to read):\n$ kubectl get pv\nNAME              CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS   ...\npvc-c71fb2c2...   1Gi        RWO            Delete           Bound    ...\n\n...   STATUS   CLAIM                         STORAGECLASS   REASON   AGE\n...   Bound    default/mongodb-pvc-default   standard                3s\n\nAs you can see, because the volume was created on demand, its properties perfectly match the requirements specified in the claim and the storage class it references.\nUnderstanding when a dynamically provisioned volume is actually provisioned\nWhy was the volume created and bound to the claim only after you had deployed the pod? In an earlier example, the pre-provisioned volume was bound to the claim as soon as you created the claim. Is this a difference between static and dynamic provisioning? The answer is no.\nThe system behaves this way because of how the storage class you’re using is configured. You may remember that its YAML definition contained a field called volumeBindingMode that was set to WaitForFirstConsumer. This mode causes the system to wait until the first pod (the consumer of the claim) exists before binding the claim. The volume is only provisioned then and not earlier.\nSome types of volumes require such behaviour, as the system needs to know where the pod is scheduled before it can provision the volume. This is the case with provisioners that create node-local volumes, such as the one you find in clusters created with the kind tool (you may remember that the provisioner referenced in the storage class was rancher.io/local-path).\nNOTE\nRefer to the documentation of your chosen provisioner to determine whether it requires the volume binding mode to be set to WaitForFirstConsumer.\n\nThe alternative to WaitForFirstConsumer is the Immediate volume binding mode. The two modes are explained in the following table.\n| Volume binding mode | Description |\n| Immediate | The provision and binding of the persistent volume takes place immediately after the claim is created. Because the consumer of the claim is unknown at this point, this mode is only applicable to volumes that are can be accessed from any cluster node. |\n| WaitForFirstConsumer | The volume is provisioned and bound to the claim when the first pod that uses this claim is created. This mode is used for topology-constrained volume types.|\nTable 8.4 Supported volume binding modes\nCreating storage classes\nAs you saw in the previous sections, a Kubernetes cluster deployed with the kind tool contains a single storage class. As I write this, the same is true for GKE clusters, but GKE uses a different provisioner that creates GCE Persistent Disks instead of local volumes.\nInspecting the standard storage class in GKE\nThe following listing shows the definition of the standard storage class in GKE. I’ve rearranged the fields since the default alphabetical ordering makes it difficult to understand.\nListing 8.9 The standard storage class in GKE\napiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1\nkind: StorageClass\nmetadata:\n  name: standard\n  annotations:\n    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: \"true\"\n    ...\nprovisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd       #A\nparameters:                             #B\n  type: pd-standard                     #B\nvolumeBindingMode: Immediate\nallowVolumeExpansion: true\nreclaimPolicy: Delete\n\n#A The provisioner used to provision volumes of this storage class\n#B This type parameter is passed to the provisioner\nAs you can see, the annotation marks this storage class as default. If you create a persistent volume claim in GKE that references either this class or none at all, the provisioner kubernetes.io/gce-pd is called to create the volume. The parameter type: pd-standard is passed to the provisioner when the volume is to be provisioned. This tells the provisioner what type of GCE Persistent Disk to create.\nNOTE\nGoogle Compute Engine supports several other disk types. Their availability depends on where you operate your cluster. To view the list of types for each availability zone, run gcloud compute disk-types list.\n\nUsing an SSD persistent disk in GKE\nOne of the disk types supported in most GCE zones is the pd-ssd type, which provisions a network-attached SSD. Let’s create a storage class called fast and configure it so that the provisioner creates a disk of type pd-ssd when you request this storage class in your claim.\nListing 8.10 A custom storage class definition: storageclass-fast-gcepd.yaml\napiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1           #A\nkind: StorageClass                      #A\nmetadata:\n  name: fast                            #B\nprovisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd       #C\nparameters:\n  type: pd-ssd                          #D\n\n#A This manifest defines a StorageClass object\n#B The name of this storage class\n#C The provisioner to use\n#D Tells the provisioner to provision an SSD disk\nNOTE \nIf you’re using another cloud provider, check their documentation to find the name of the provisioner and the parameters you need to pass in. If you’re using Minikube or kind, and you’d like to run this example, set the provisioner and parameters to the same values as in the default storage class. For this exercise, it doesn’t matter if the provisioned volume doesn’t actually use an SSD.\n\nCreate the StorageClass object by applying this manifest to your cluster and list the available storage classes to confirm that more than one is now available.\nRequesting the storage class in a persistent volume claim\nWhenever more than one storage class is available in your Kubernetes cluster, you can explicitly specify which of them the claim should use. You’ve already learned that this is done using the storageClassName field in the PersistentVolumeClaim object. Let’s conclude this section on dynamic provisioning by creating a persistent volume claim that will allow your MongoDB pod to use an SSD disk.\nClaiming a volume of a specific storage class\nThe following listing shows the updated YAML definition of the mongodb-pvc claim requesting the storage class fast. You can find it in the mongodb-pvc-dynamic-fast.yaml file in the book’s GitHub repository.\nListing 8.11 A persistent volume claim requesting a specific storage class\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: mongodb-pvc-fast\nspec:\n  storageClassName: fast           #A\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 1Gi\n  accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteOnce\n\n#A This claim requests that this specific storage class be used to provision the volume.\nRather than just specifying the size and access modes and letting the system use the default storage class to provision the persistent volume, this claim specifies that the storage class fast be used for the volume. When you create the claim, the persistent volume is created by the provisioner referenced in this storage class.\nYou can now use this claim in a new MongoDB pod. If you run this example on GKE, the pod will use an SSD volume.\nNOTE \nIf a persistent volume claim refers to a non-existent storage class, the claim remains Pending until the storage class is created. Kubernetes attempts to bind the claim at regular intervals, generating a ProvisioningFailed event each time. You can see the event if you execute the kubectl describe command on the claim.\n\nResizing persistent volumes\nIf the cluster supports dynamic provisioning, a cluster user can self-provision a storage volume with the properties and size specified in the claim and referenced storage class. If the user later needs a different storage class for their volume, they must, as you might expect, create a new persistent volume claim that references the other storage class. Kubernetes does not support changing the storage class name in an existing claim. If you try to do so, you receive the following error message:\n* spec: Forbidden: is immutable after creation except resources.requests for bound claims\n\nThe error indicates that the majority of the claim’s specification is immutable. The part that is mutable is spec.resources.requests, which is where you indicate the desired size of the volume.\nIn the previous MongoDB examples you requested 1GiB of storage space. Now imagine that the database grows near this size. Can the volume be resized without restarting the pod and application? Let’s find out.\nRequesting a larger volume in an existing persistent volume claim\nIf you use dynamic provisioning, you can generally change the size of a persistent volume simply by requesting a larger capacity in the associated claim. For the next exercise, you’ll increase the size of the volume by modifying the mongodb-pvc-default claim, which should still exist in your cluster.\nTo modify the claim, either edit the manifest file or create a copy and then edit it. Set the spec.resources.requests.storage field to 10Gi as shown in the following listing. You can find this manifest in the book’s GitHub repository (file mongodb-pvc-dynamic-default-10gib.yaml).\nListing 8.12 Requesting a larger volume\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: mongodb-pvc-default           #A\nspec:                       \n  resources:                          #B\n    requests:                         #B\n      storage: 10Gi                   #B\n  accessModes:              \n    - ReadWriteOnce\n\n#A Ensure that the name matches the name of the existing claim.\n#B Request a larger amount of storage.\nWhen you apply this file with the kubectl apply command, the existing PersistentVolumeClaim object is updated. Use the kubectl get pvc command to see if the volume’s capacity has increased:\n$ kubectl get pvc mongodb-pvc-default\nNAME                  STATUS   VOLUME         CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   ...\nmongodb-pvc-default   Bound    pvc-ed36b...   1Gi        RWO            ...\n\nYou may recall that when claims are listed, the CAPACITY column displays the size of the bound volume and not the size requirement specified in the claim. According to the output, this means that the size of the volume hasn’t changed. Let’s find out why.\nDetermining why the volume hasn’t been resized\nTo find out why the size of the volume has remained the same regardless of the change you made to the claim, the first thing you might do is inspect the claim using kubectl describe.  If this is the case, you’ve already got the hang of debugging objects in Kubernetes. You’ll find that one of the claim’s conditions clearly explains why the volume was not resized:\n$ kubectl describe pvc mongodb-pvc-default\n...\nConditions:\n  Type                      Status  ... Message\n  ----                      ------  ... -------\n  FileSystemResizePending   True        Waiting for user to (re-)start a\n                                        pod to finish file system resize of\n                                        volume on node.\n\nTo resize the persistent volume, you need to delete and recreate the pod that uses the claim. After you do this, the claim and the volume will display the new size:\n$ kubectl get pvc mongodb-pvc-default\nNAME                  STATUS   VOLUME         CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   ...\nmongodb-pvc-default   Bound    pvc-ed36b...   10Gi        RWO           ...\n\nAllowing and disallowing volume expansion in the storage class\nThe previous example shows that cluster users can increase the size of the bound persistent volume by changing the storage requirement in the persistent volume claim. However, this is only possible if it’s supported by the provisioner and the storage class.\nWhen the cluster administrator creates a storage class, they can use the spec.allowVolumeExpansion field to indicate whether volumes of this class can be resized. If you attempt to expand a volume that you’re not supposed to expand, the API server immediately rejects the update operation on the claim.\nUnderstanding the benefits of dynamic provisioning\nThis section on dynamic provisioning should convince you that automating the provisioning of persistent volumes benefits both the cluster administrator and anyone who uses the cluster to deploy applications. By setting up the dynamic volume provisioner and configuring several storage classes with different performance or other features, the administrator gives cluster users the ability to provision as many persistent volumes of any type as they want. Each developer decides which storage class is best suited for each claim they create.\nUnderstanding how storage classes allow claims to be portable\nAnother great thing about storage classes is that claims refer to them by name. If the storage classes are named appropriately, such as standard, fast, and so on, the persistent volume claim manifests are portable across different clusters.\nNOTE\nRemember that persistent volume claims are usually part of the application manifest and are written by application developers.\n\nIf you used GKE to run the previous examples, you can now try to deploy the same claim and pod manifests in a non-GKE cluster, such as a cluster created with Minikube or kind. In this way, you can see this portability for yourself. The only thing you need to ensure is that all your clusters use the storage class names.\nUnderstanding the lifecycle of dynamically provisioned persistent volumes\nTo conclude this section on dynamic provisions, let’s take one final look at the lifecycles of the underlying storage volume, the PersistentVolume object, the associated PersistentVolumeClaim object, and the pods that use them, like we did in the previous section on statically provisioned volumes.\nFigure 8.10 The lifecycle of dynamically provisioned persistent volumes, claims and the pods using them\n\nUnlike statically provisioned persistent volumes, the sequence of events when using dynamic provisioning begins with the creation of the PersistentVolumeClaim object. As soon as one such object appears, Kubernetes instructs the dynamic provisioner configured in the storage class referenced in this claim to provision a volume for it. The provisioner creates both the underlying storage, typically through the cloud provider’s API, and the PersistentVolume object that references the underlying volume.\nThe underlying volume is typically provisioned asynchronously. When the process completes, the status of the PersistentVolume object changes to Available; at this point, the volume is bound to the claim.\nUsers can then deploy pods that refer to the claim to gain access to the underlying storage volume. When the volume is no longer needed, the user deletes the claim. This typically triggers the deletion of both the PersistentVolume object and the underlying storage volume.\nThis entire process is repeated for each new claim that the user creates. A new PersistentVolume object is created for each claim, which means that the cluster can never run out of them. Obviously, the datacentre itself can run out of available disk space, but at least there is no need for the administrator to keep recycling old PersistentVolume objects.\n"},"docs/Nodelocal_persistent_volumes.html":{"url":"docs/Nodelocal_persistent_volumes.html","title":"8.4 Node-local persistent volumes","keywords":"","body":"8.4 Node-local persistent volumes\nIn the previous sections of this chapter, you’ve used persistent volumes and claims to provide network-attached storage volumes to your pods, but this type of storage is too slow for some applications. To run a production-grade database, you should probably use an SSD connected directly to the node where the database is running.\nIn the previous chapter, you learned that you can use a hostPath volume in a pod if you want the pod to access part of the host’s filesystem. Now you’ll learn how to do the same with persistent volumes. You might wonder why I need to teach you another way to do the same thing, but it’s really not the same.\nYou might remember that when you add a hostPath volume to a pod, the data that the pod sees depends on which node the pod is scheduled to. In other words, if the pod is deleted and recreated, it might end up on another node and no longer have access to the same data.\nIf you use a local persistent volume instead, this problem is resolved. The Kubernetes scheduler ensures that the pod is always scheduled on the node to which the local volume is attached.\nNOTE\nLocal persistent volumes are also better than hostPath volumes because they offer much better security. As explained in the previous chapter, you don’t want to allow regular users to use hostPath volumes at all. Because persistent volumes are managed by the cluster administrator, regular users can’t use them to access arbitrary paths on the host node.\n\nCreating local persistent volumes\nImagine you are a cluster administrator and you have just connected a fast SSD directly to one of the worker nodes. Because this is a new class of storage in the cluster, it makes sense to create a new StorageClass object that represents it.\nCreating a storage class to represent local storage\nCreate a new storage class manifest as shown in the following listing.\nListing 8.13 Defining the local storage class\napiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1\nkind: StorageClass\nmetadata:\n  name: local                                 #A\nprovisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner     #B\nvolumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer       #C\n\n#A Let’s call this storage class local\n#B Persistent volumes of this class are provisioned manually\n#C The persistent volume claim should be bound only when the first pod that uses the claim is deployed.\nAs I write this, locally attached persistent volumes need to be provisioned manually, so you need to set the provisioner as shown in the listing. Because this storage class represents locally attached volumes that can only be accessed within the nodes to which they are physically connected, the volumeBindingMode is set to WaitForFirstConsumer, so the binding of the claim is delayed until the pod is scheduled.\nAttaching a disk to a cluster node\nI assume that you’re using a Kubernetes cluster created with the kind tool to run this exercise. Let’s emulate the installation of the SSD in the node called kind-worker. Run the following command to create an empty directory at the location /mnt/ssd1 in the node’s filesystem:\n$ docker exec kind-worker mkdir /mnt/ssd1\n\nCreating a PersistentVolume object for the new disk\nAfter attaching the disk to one of the nodes, you must tell Kubernetes that this node now provides a local persistent volume by creating a PersistentVolume object. The manifest for the persistent volume is shown in the following listing.\nListing 8.14 Defining a local persistent volume\nkind: PersistentVolume\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: local-ssd-on-kind-worker              #A\nspec:\n  accessModes:\n  - ReadWriteOnce\n  storageClassName: local                     #B\n  capacity:\n    storage: 10Gi\n  local:                                      #C\n    path: /mnt/ssd1                           #C\n  nodeAffinity:                               #D\n    required:                                 #D\n      nodeSelectorTerms:                      #D\n      - matchExpressions:                     #D\n        - key: kubernetes.io/hostname         #D\n          operator: In                        #D\n          values:                             #D\n          - kind-worker                       #D\n\n#A This persistent volume represents the local SSD installed in the kind-worker node, hence the name.\n#B This volume belongs to the local storage class.\n#C This volume is mounted in the node’s filesystem at the specified path.\n#D This section tells Kubernetes which nodes can access this volume. Since the SSD is attached only to the node kind-worker, it is only accessible on this node.\nBecause this persistent volume represents a local disk attached to the kind-worker node, you give it a name that conveys this information. It refers to the local storage class that you created previously. Unlike previous persistent volumes, this volume represents storage space that is directly attached to the node. You therefore specify that it is a local volume. Within the local volume configuration, you also specify the path where the SSD is mounted (/mnt/ssd1).\nAt the bottom of the manifest, you’ll find several lines that indicate the volume’s node affinity. A volume’s node affinity defines which nodes can access this volume.\nNOTE\nYou’ll learn more about node affinity and selectors in later chapters. Although it looks complicated, the node affinity definition in the listing simply defines that the volume is accessible from nodes whose hostname is kind-worker. This is obviously exactly one node.\n\nOkay, as a cluster administrator, you’ve now done everything you needed to do to enable cluster users to deploy applications that use locally attached persistent volumes. Now it’s time to put your application developer hat back on again.\nClaiming and using local persistent volumes\nAs an application developer, you can now deploy your pod and its associated persistent volume claim.\nCreating the pod\nThe pod definition is shown in the following listing.\nListing 8.15 Pod using a locally attached persistent volume\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: mongodb-local\nspec:\n  volumes:\n  - name: mongodb-data\n    persistentVolumeClaim:\n      claimName: mongodb-pvc-local            #A\n  containers:\n  - image: mongo\n    name: mongodb\n    volumeMounts:\n    - name: mongodb-data\n      mountPath: /data/db\n\n#A The pod uses the mongodb-pvc-local claim\nThere should be no surprises in the pod manifest. You already know all this.\nCreating the persistent volume claim for a local volume\nAs with the pod, creating the claim for a local persistent volume is no different than creating any other persistent volume claim. The manifest is shown in the next listing.\nListing 8.16 Persistent volume claim using the local storage class\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: mongodb-pvc-local\nspec:\n  storageClassName: local                  #A\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 1Gi\n  accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteOnce\n\n#A The claim requests a persistent volume from the local storage class\nNo surprises here either. Now on to creating these two objects.\nCreating the pod and the claim\nAfter you write the pod and claim manifests, you can create the two objects by applying the manifests in any order you want. If you create the pod first, since the pod requires the claim to exist, it simply remains in the Pending state until you create the claim.\nAfter both the pod and the claim are created, the following events take place:\n\nThe claim is bound to the persistent volume.\nThe scheduler determines that the volume bound to the claim that is used in the pod can only be accessed from the kind-worker node, so it schedules the pod to this node.\nThe pod’s container is started on this node, and the volume is mounted in it.\n\nYou can now use the MongoDB shell again to add documents to it. Then check the /mnt/ssd1 directory on the kind-worker node to see if the files are stored there.\nRecreating the pod\nIf you delete and recreate the pod, you’ll see that it’s always scheduled on the kind-worker node. The same happens if multiple nodes can provide a local persistent volume when you deploy the pod for the first time. At this point, the scheduler selects one of them to run your MongoDB pod. When the pod runs, the claim is bound to the persistent volume on that particular node. If you then delete and recreate the pod, it is always scheduled on the same node, since that is where the volume that is bound to the claim referenced in the pod is located.\n"},"docs/Summary_8.html":{"url":"docs/Summary_8.html","title":"8.5 Summary","keywords":"","body":"8.5 Summary\nThis chapter explained the details of adding persistent storage for your applications.
