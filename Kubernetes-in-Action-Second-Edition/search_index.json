you for purchasing the MEAP for Kubernetes in Action 2nd Edition.\nAs part of my work at Red Hat, I started using Kubernetes in 2014, even before version 1.0 was released. Those were interesting times. Not many people working in the software industry knew about Kubernetes, and there was no real community yet. There were hardly any blog posts about it and the documentation was still very basic. Kubernetes itself was ridden with bugs. When you combine all these facts, you can imagine that working with Kubernetes was extremely difficult.\nIn 2015 I was asked by Manning to write the first edition of this book. The originally planned 300-page book grew to over 600 pages full of information. The writing forced me to also research those parts of Kubernetes that I wouldn’t have looked at more closely otherwise. I put most of what I learned into the book. Judging by their reviews and comments, readers love a detailed book like this.\nThe plan for the second edition of the book is to add even more information and to rearrange some of the existing content. The exercises in this book will take you from deploying a trivial application that initially uses only the basic features of Kubernetes to a full-fledged application that incorporates additional features as the book introduces them.\nThe book is divided into five parts. In the first part, after the introduction of Kubernetes and containers, you’ll deploy the application in the simplest way. In the second part you’ll learn the main concepts used to describe and deploy your application. After that you’ll explore the inner workings of Kubernetes components. This will give you a good foundation to learn the difficult part - how to manage Kubernetes in production. In the last part of the book you’ll learn about best practices and how to extend Kubernetes.\nI hope you all like this second edition even better than the first, and if you’re reading the book for the first time, your feedback will be even more valuable. If any part of the book is difficult to understand, please post your questions, comments or suggestions in the liveBook forum.\nThank you for helping me write the best book possible.\n—Marko Lukša\n"},"docs/Introducing_Kubernetes_0.html":{"url":"docs/Introducing_Kubernetes_0.html","title":"1 Introducing Kubernetes","keywords":"","body":"Introducing Kubernetes\nThis chapter covers\n\nIntroductory information about Kubernetes and its origins\nWhy Kubernetes has seen such wide adoption\nHow Kubernetes transforms your data center\nAn overview of its architecture and operation\nHow and if you should integrate Kubernetes into your own organization\n\nBefore you can learn about the ins and outs of running applications with Kubernetes, you must first gain a basic understanding of the problems Kubernetes is designed to solve, how it came about, and its impact on application development and deployment.

A helmsman is not necessarily the same as a captain. A captain is responsible for the ship, while the helmsman is the one who steers it.\nAfter learning more about what Kubernetes does, you’ll find that the name hits the spot perfectly. A helmsman maintains the course of the ship, carries out the orders given by the captain and reports back the ship's heading. Kubernetes steers your applications and reports on their status while you - the captain - decide where you want the system to go.\nHow to pronounce Kubernetes and what is k8s?\nThe correct Greek pronunciation of Kubernetes, which is Kie-ver-nee-tees, is different from the English pronunciation you normally hear in technical conversations. Most often it’s Koo-ber-netties or Koo-ber-nay’-tace, but you may also hear Koo-ber-nets, although rarely.\nIn both written and oral conversations, it’s also referred to as Kube or K8s, pronounced Kates, where the 8 signifies the number of letters omitted between the first and last letter.\nKubernetes in a nutshell\nKubernetes is a software system for automating the deployment and management of complex, large-scale application systems composed of computer processes running in containers. Let’s learn what it does and how it does it.\nAbstracting away the infrastructure\nWhen software developers or operators decide to deploy an application, they do this through Kubernetes instead of deploying the application to individual computers. Kubernetes provides an abstraction layer over the underlying hardware to both users and applications.\nAs you can see in the following figure, the underlying infrastructure, meaning the computers, the network and other components, is hidden from the applications, making it easier to develop and configure them.\nFigure 1.1 Infrastructure abstraction using Kubernetes\n\nStandardizing how we deploy applications\nBecause the details of the underlying infrastructure no longer affect the deployment of applications, you deploy applications to your corporate data center in the same way as you do in the cloud. A single manifest that describes the application can be used for local deployment and for deploying on any cloud provider. All differences in the underlying infrastructure are handled by Kubernetes, so you can focus on the application and the business logic it contains.\nDeploying applications declaratively\nKubernetes uses a declarative model to define an application, as shown in the next figure. You describe the components that make up your application and Kubernetes turns this description into a running application. It then keeps the application healthy by restarting or recreating parts of it as needed.\nFigure 1.2 The declarative model of application deployment\n\nWhenever you change the description, Kubernetes will take the necessary steps to reconfigure the running application to match the new description, as shown in the next figure.\nFigure 1.3 Changes in the description are reflected in the running application\n\nTaking on the daily management of applications\nAs soon as you deploy an application to Kubernetes, it takes over the daily management of the application. If the application fails, Kubernetes will automatically restart it. If the hardware fails or the infrastructure topology changes so that the application needs to be moved to other machines, Kubernetes does this all by itself. The engineers responsible for operating the system can focus on the big picture instead of wasting time on the details.\nTo circle back to the sailing analogy: the development and operations engineers are the ship’s officers who make high-level decisions while sitting comfortably in their armchairs, and Kubernetes is the helmsman who takes care of the low-level tasks of steering the system through the rough waters your applications and infrastructure sail through.\nFigure 1.4 Kubernetes takes over the management of applications\n\nEverything that Kubernetes does and all the advantages it brings requires a longer explanation, which we’ll discuss later. Before we do that, it might help you to know how it all began and where the Kubernetes project currently stands.\nAbout the Kubernetes project\nKubernetes was originally developed by Google. Google has practically always run applications in containers. As early as 2014, it was reported that they start two billion containers every week. That’s over 3,000 containers per second, and the figure is much higher today. They run these containers on thousands of computers distributed across dozens of data centers around the world. Now imagine doing all this manually. It’s clear that you need automation, and at this massive scale, it better be perfect.\nAbout Borg and Omega - the predecessors of Kubernetes\nThe sheer scale of Google’s workload has forced them to develop solutions to make the development and management of thousands of software components manageable and cost-effective. Over the years, Google developed an internal system called Borg (and later a new system called Omega) that helped both application developers and operators manage these thousands of applications and services.\nIn addition to simplifying development and management, these systems have also helped them to achieve better utilization of their infrastructure. This is important in any organization, but when you operate hundreds of thousands of machines, even tiny improvements in utilization mean savings in the millions, so the incentives for developing such a system are clear.\nNOTE\nData on Google’s energy use suggests that they run around 900,000 servers.\n\nOver time, your infrastructure grows and evolves. Every new data center is state-of-the-art. Its infrastructure differs from those built in the past. Despite the differences, the deployment of applications in one data center should not differ from deployment in another data center. This is especially important when you deploy your application across multiple zones or regions to reduce the likelihood that a regional failure will cause application downtime. To do this effectively, it’s worth having a consistent method for deploying your applications.\nAbout Kubernetes - the open-source project - and commercial products derived from it\nBased on the experience they gained while developing Borg, Omega and other internal systems, in 2014 Google introduced Kubernetes, an open-source project that can now be used and further improved by everyone.\nFigure 1.5 The origins and state of the Kubernetes open-source project\n\nAs soon as Kubernetes was announced, long before version 1.0 was officially released, other companies, such as Red Hat, who has always been at the forefront of open-source software, quickly stepped on board and helped develop the project. It eventually grew far beyond the expectations of its founders, and today is arguably one of the world’s leading open-source projects, with dozens of organizations and thousands of individuals contributing to it.\nSeveral companies are now offering enterprise-quality Kubernetes products that are built from the open-source project. These include Red Hat OpenShift, Pivotal Container Service, Rancher and many others.\nHow Kubernetes grew a whole new cloud-native eco-system\nKubernetes has also spawned many other related open-source projects, most of which are now under the umbrella of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which is part of the Linux Foundation.\nCNCF organizes several KubeCon - CloudNativeCon conferences per year - in North America, Europe and China. In 2019, the total number of attendees exceeded 23,000, with KubeCon North America reaching an overwhelming number of 12,000 participants. These figures show that Kubernetes has had an incredibly positive impact on the way companies around the world deploy applications today. It wouldn’t have been so widely adopted if that wasn’t the case.\nUnderstanding why Kubernetes is so popular\nIn recent years, the way we develop applications has changed considerably. This has led to the development of new tools like Kubernetes, which in turn have fed back and fuelled further changes in application architecture and the way we develop them. Let’s look at concrete examples of this.\nAutomating the management of microservices\nIn the past, most applications were large monoliths. The components of the application were tightly coupled, and they all ran in a single computer process. The application was developed as a unit by a large team of developers and the deployment of the application was straightforward. You installed it on a powerful computer and provided the little configuration it required. Scaling the application horizontally was rarely possible, so whenever you needed to increase the capacity of the application, you had to upgrade the hardware - in other words, scale the application vertically.\nThen came the microservices paradigm. The monoliths were divided into dozens, sometimes hundreds, of separate processes, as shown in the following figure. This allowed organizations to divide their development departments into smaller teams where each team developed only a part of the entire system - just some of the microservices.\nFigure 1.6 Comparing monolithic applications with microservices\n\nEach microservice is now a separate application with its own development and release cycle. The dependencies of different microservices will inevitably diverge over time. One microservice requires one version of a library, while another microservice requires another, possibly incompatible, version of the same library. Running the two applications in the same operating system becomes difficult.\nFortunately, containers alone solve this problem where each microservice requires a different environment, but each microservice is now a separate application that must be managed individually. The increased number of applications makes this much more difficult.\nIndividual parts of the entire application no longer need to run on the same computer, which makes it easier to scale the entire system, but also means that the applications need to be configured to communicate with each other. For systems with only a handful of components, this can usually be done manually, but it’s now common to see deployments with well over a hundred microservices.\nWhen the system consists of many microservices, automated management is crucial. Kubernetes provides this automation. The features it offers make the task of managing hundreds of microservices almost trivial.\nBridging the dev and ops divide\nAlong with these changes in application architecture, we’ve also seen changes in the way teams develop and run software. It used to be normal for a development team to build the software in isolation and then throw the finished product over the wall to the operations team, who would then deploy it and manage it from there.\nWith the advent of the Dev-ops paradigm, the two teams now work much more closely together throughout the entire life of the software product. The development team is now much more involved in the daily management of the deployed software. But that means that they now need to know about the infrastructure on which it’s running.\nAs a software developer, your primary focus is on implementing the business logic. You don’t want to deal with the details of the underlying servers. Fortunately, Kubernetes hides these details.\nStandardizing the cloud\nOver the past decade or two, many organizations have moved their software from local servers to the cloud. The benefits of this seem to have outweighed the fear of being locked-in to a particular cloud provider, which is caused by relying on the provider’s proprietary APIs to deploy and manage applications.\nAny company that wants to be able to move its applications from one provider to another will have to make additional, initially unnecessary efforts to abstract the infrastructure and APIs of the underlying cloud provider from the applications. This requires resources that could otherwise be focused on building the primary business logic.\nKubernetes has also helped in this respect. The popularity of Kubernetes has forced all major cloud providers to integrate Kubernetes into their offerings. Customers can now deploy applications to any cloud provider through a standard set of APIs provided by Kubernetes.\nFigure 1.7 Kubernetes has standardized how you deploy applications on cloud providers\n\nIf the application is built on the APIs of Kubernetes instead of directly on the proprietary APIs of a specific cloud provider, it can be transferred relatively easily to any other provider.\n"},"docs/Understanding_Kubernetes.html":{"url":"docs/Understanding_Kubernetes.html","title":"1.2 Understanding Kubernetes","keywords":"","body":"Understanding Kubernetes\nThe previous section explained the origins of Kubernetes and the reasons for its wide adoption. In this section we’ll take a closer look at what exactly Kubernetes is.\nUnderstanding how Kubernetes transforms a computer cluster\nLet’s take a closer look at how the perception of the data center changes when you deploy Kubernetes on your servers.\nKubernetes is like an operating system for computer clusters\nOne can imagine Kubernetes as an operating system for the cluster. The next figure illustrates the analogies between an operating system running on a computer and Kubernetes running on a cluster of computers.\nFigure 1.8 Kubernetes is to a computer cluster what an Operating System is to a computer\n\nJust as an operating system supports the basic functions of a computer, such as scheduling processes onto its CPUs and acting as an interface between the application and the computer’s hardware, Kubernetes schedules the components of a distributed application onto individual computers in the underlying computer cluster and acts as an interface between the application and the cluster.\nIt frees application developers from the need to implement infrastructure-related mechanisms in their applications; instead, they rely on Kubernetes to provide them. This includes things like:\n\nservice discovery - a mechanism that allows applications to find other applications and use the services they provide,\nhorizontal scaling - replicating your application to adjust to fluctuations in load,\nload-balancing - distributing load across all the application replicas,\nself-healing - keeping the system healthy by automatically restarting failed applications and moving them to healthy nodes after their nodes fail,\nleader election - a mechanism that decides which instance of the application should be active while the others remain idle but ready to take over if the active instance fails.\n\n\nBy relying on Kubernetes to provide these features, application developers can focus on implementing the core business logic instead of wasting time integrating applications with the infrastructure.\nHow Kubernetes fits into a computer cluster\nTo get a concrete example of how Kubernetes is deployed onto a cluster of computers, look at the following figure.\nFigure 1.9 Computers in a Kubernetes cluster are divided into the Control Plane and the Workload Plane\n\nYou start with a fleet of machines that you divide into two groups - the master and the worker nodes. The master nodes will run the Kubernetes Control Plane, which represents the brain of your system and controls the cluster, while the rest will run your applications - your workloads - and will therefore represent the Workload Plane.\nNOTE\nThe Workload Plane is sometimes referred to as the Data Plane, but this term could be confusing because the plane doesn’t host data but applications. Don’t be confused by the term “plane” either - in this context you can think of it as the “surface” the applications run on.\n\nNon-production clusters can use a single master node, but highly available clusters use at least three physical master nodes to host the Control Plane. The number of worker nodes depends on the number of applications you’ll deploy.\nHow all cluster nodes become one large deployment area\nAfter Kubernetes is installed on the computers, you no longer need to think about individual computers when deploying applications. Regardless of the number of worker nodes in your cluster, they all become a single space where you deploy your applications. You do this using the Kubernetes API, which is provided by the Kubernetes Control Plane.\nFigure 1.10 Kubernetes exposes the cluster as a uniform deployment area\n\nWhen I say that all worker nodes become one space, I don’t want you to think that you can deploy an extremely large application that is spread across several small machines. Kubernetes doesn’t do magic tricks like this. Each application must be small enough to fit on one of the worker nodes.\nWhat I meant was that when deploying applications, it doesn’t matter which worker node they end up on. Kubernetes may later even move the application from one node to another. You may not even notice when that happens, and you shouldn’t care.\nThe benefits of using Kubernetes\nYou’ve already learned why many organizations across the world have welcomed Kubernetes into their data centers. Now, let’s take a closer look at the specific benefits it brings to both development and IT operations teams.\nSelf-service deployment of applications\nBecause Kubernetes presents all its worker nodes as a single deployment surface, it no longer matters which node you deploy your application to. This means that developers can now deploy applications on their own, even if they don’t know anything about the number of nodes or the characteristics of each node.\nIn the past, the system administrators were the ones who decided where each application should be placed. This task is now left to Kubernetes. This allows a developer to deploy applications without having to rely on other people to do so. When a developer deploys an application, Kubernetes chooses the best node on which to run the application based on the resource requirements of the application and the resources available on each node.\nReducing costs via better infrastructure utilization\nIf you don’t care which node your application lands on, it also means that it can be moved to any other node at any time without you having to worry about it. Kubernetes may need to do this to make room for a larger application that someone wants to deploy. This ability to move applications allows the applications to be packed tightly together so that the resources of the nodes can be utilized in the best possible way.\nNOTE\nIn chapter 17 you’ll learn more about how Kubernetes decides where to place each application and how you can influence the decision.\n\nFinding optimal combinations can be challenging and time consuming, especially when the number of all possible options is huge, such as when you have many application components and many server nodes on which they can be deployed. Computers can perform this task much better and faster than humans. Kubernetes does it very well. By combining different applications on the same machines, Kubernetes improves the utilization of your hardware infrastructure so you can run more applications on fewer servers.\nAutomatically adjusting to changing load\nUsing Kubernetes to manage your deployed applications also means that the operations team doesn’t have to constantly monitor the load of each application to respond to sudden load peaks. Kubernetes takes care of this also. It can monitor the resources consumed by each application and other metrics and adjust the number of running instances of each application to cope with increased load or resource usage.\nWhen you run Kubernetes on cloud infrastructure, it can even increase the size of your cluster by provisioning additional nodes through the cloud provider’s API. This way, you never run out of space to run additional instances of your applications.\nKeeping applications running smoothly\nKubernetes also makes every effort to ensure that your applications run smoothly. If your application crashes, Kubernetes will restart it automatically. So even if you have a broken application that runs out of memory after running for more than a few hours, Kubernetes will ensure that your application continues to provide the service to its users by automatically restarting it in this case.\nKubernetes is a self-healing system in that it deals with software errors like the one just described, but it also handles hardware failures. As clusters grow in size, the frequency of node failure also increases. For example, in a cluster with one hundred nodes and a MTBF (mean-time-between-failure) of 100 days for each node, you can expect one node to fail every day.\nWhen a node fails, Kubernetes automatically moves applications to the remaining healthy nodes. The operations team no longer needs to manually move the application and can instead focus on repairing the node itself and returning it to the pool of available hardware resources.\nIf your infrastructure has enough free resources to allow normal system operation without the failed node, the operations team doesn’t even have to react immediately to the failure. If it occurs in the middle of the night, no one from the operations team even has to wake up. They can sleep peacefully and deal with the failed node during regular working hours.\nSimplifying application development\nThe improvements described in the previous section mainly concern application deployment. But what about the process of application development? Does Kubernetes bring anything to their table? It definitely does.\nAs mentioned previously, Kubernetes offers infrastructure-related services that would otherwise have to be implemented in your applications. This includes the discovery of services and/or peers in a distributed application, leader election, centralized application configuration and others. Kubernetes provides this while keeping the application Kubernetes-agnostic, but when required, applications can also query the Kubernetes API to obtain detailed information about their environment. They can also use the API to change the environment.\nThe architecture of a Kubernetes cluster\nAs you’ve already learned, a Kubernetes cluster consists of nodes divided into two groups:\n\nA set of master nodes that host the Control Plane components, which are the brains of the system, since they control the entire cluster.\nA set of worker nodes that form the Workload Plane, which is where your workloads (or applications) run.\n\nThe following figure shows the two planes and the different nodes they consist of.\nFigure 1.11 The two planes that make up a Kubernetes cluster\n\nThe two planes, and hence the two types of nodes, run different Kubernetes components. The next two sections of the book introduce them and summarize their functions without going into details. These components will be mentioned several times in the next part of the book where I explain the fundamental concepts of Kubernetes. An in-depth look at the components and their internals follows in the third part of the book.\nControl Plane components\nThe Control Plane is what controls the cluster. It consists of several components that run on a single master node or are replicated across multiple master nodes to ensure high availability. The Control Plane’s components are shown in the following figure.\nFigure 1.12 The components of the Kubernetes Control Plane\n\nThese are the components and their functions:\n\nThe Kubernetes API Server exposes the RESTful Kubernetes API. Engineers using the cluster and other Kubernetes components create objects via this API.\nThe etcd distributed datastore persists the objects you create through the API, since the API Server itself is stateless. The Server is the only component that talks to etcd.\nThe Scheduler decides on which worker node each application instance should run.\nControllers bring to life the objects you create through the API. Most of them simply create other objects, but some also communicate with external systems (for example, the cloud provider via its API).\n\nThe components of the Control Plane hold and control the state of the cluster, but they don’t run your applications. This is done by the (worker) nodes.\nWorker node components\nThe worker nodes are the computers on which your applications run. They form the cluster’s Workload Plane. In addition to applications, several Kubernetes components also run on these nodes. They perform the task of running, monitoring and providing connectivity between your applications. They are shown in the following figure.\nFigure 1.13 The Kubernetes components that run on each node\n\nEach node runs the following set of components:\n\nThe Kubelet, an agent that talks to the API server and manages the applications running on its node. It reports the status of these applications and the node via the API.\nThe Container Runtime, which can be Docker or any other runtime compatible with Kubernetes. It runs your applications in containers as instructed by the Kubelet.\nThe Kubernetes Service Proxy (Kube Proxy) load-balances network traffic between applications. Its name suggests that traffic flows through it, but that’s no longer the case. You’ll learn why in chapter 14.\n\nAdd-on components\nMost Kubernetes clusters also contain several other components. This includes a DNS server, network plugins, logging agents and many others. They typically run on the worker nodes but can also be configured to run on the master.\nGaining a deeper understanding of the architecture\nFor now, I only expect you to be vaguely familiar with the names of these components and their function, as I’ll mention them many times throughout the following chapters. You’ll learn snippets about them in these chapters, but I’ll explain them in more detail in chapter 14.\nI’m not a fan of explaining how things work until I first explain what something does and teach you how to use it. It’s like learning to drive. You don’t want to know what’s under the hood. At first, you just want to learn how to get from point A to B. Only then will you be interested in how the car makes this possible. Knowing what’s under the hood may one day help you get your car moving again after it has broken down and you are stranded on the side of the road. I hate to say it, but you’ll have many moments like this when dealing with Kubernetes due to its sheer complexity.\nHow Kubernetes runs an application\nWith a general overview of the components that make up Kubernetes, I can finally explain how to deploy an application in Kubernetes.\nDefining your application\nEverything in Kubernetes is represented by an object. You create and retrieve these objects via the Kubernetes API. Your application consists of several types of these objects - one type represents the application deployment as a whole, another represents a running instance of your application, another represents the service provided by a set of these instances and allows reaching them at a single IP address, and there are many others.\nAll these types are explained in detail in the second part of the book. At the moment, it’s enough to know that you define your application through several types of objects. These objects are usually defined in one or more manifest files in either YAML or JSON format.\nDEFINITION\nYAML was initially said to mean “Yet Another Markup Language”, but it was latter changed to the recursive acronym “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. It’s one of the ways to serialize an object into a human-readable text file.\n\nDEFINITION\nJSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation. It’s a different way of serializing an object, but more suitable for exchanging data between applications.\n\nThe following figure shows an example of deploying an application by creating a manifest with two deployments exposed using two services.\nFigure 1.14 Deploying an application to Kubernetes\n\nThese actions take place when you deploy the application:\n\nYou submit the application manifest to the Kubernetes API. The API Server writes the objects defined in the manifest to etcd.\nA controller notices the newly created objects and creates several new objects - one for each application instance.\nThe Scheduler assigns a node to each instance.\nThe Kubelet notices that an instance is assigned to the Kubelet’s node. It runs the application instance via the Container Runtime.\nThe Kube Proxy notices that the application instances are ready to accept connections from clients and configures a load balancer for them.\nThe Kubelets and the Controllers monitor the system and keep the applications running.\n\nThe procedure is explained in more detail in the following sections, but the complete explanation is given in chapter 14, after you have familiarized yourself with all the objects and controllers involved.\nSubmitting the application to the API\nAfter you’ve created your YAML or JSON file(s), you submit the file to the API, usually via the Kubernetes command-line tool called kubectl.\nNOTE\nKubectl is pronounced kube-control, but the softer souls in the community prefer to call it kube-cuddle. Some refer to it as kube-C-T-L.\n\nKubectl splits the file into individual objects and creates each of them by sending an HTTP PUT or POST request to the API, as is usually the case with RESTful APIs. The API Server validates the objects and stores them in the etcd datastore. In addition, it notifies all interested components that these objects have been created. Controllers, which are explained next, are one of these components.\nAbout the controllers\nMost object types have an associated controller. A controller is interested in a particular object type. It waits for the API server to notify it that a new object has been created, and then performs operations to bring that object to life. Typically, the controller just creates other objects via the same Kubernetes API. For example, the controller responsible for application deployments creates one or more objects that represent individual instances of the application. The number of objects created by the controller depends on the number of replicas specified in the application deployment object.\nAbout the Scheduler\nThe scheduler is a special type of controller, whose only task is to schedule application instances onto worker nodes. It selects the best worker node for each new application instance object and assigns it to the instance - by modifying the object via the API.\nAbout the Kubelet and the Container Runtime\nThe Kubelet that runs on each worker node is also a type of controller. Its task is to wait for application instances to be assigned to the node on which it is located and run the application. This is done by instructing the Container Runtime to start the application’s container.\nAbout the Kube Proxy\nBecause an application deployment can consist of multiple application instances, a load balancer is required to expose them at a single IP address. The Kube Proxy, another controller running alongside the Kubelet, is responsible for setting up the load balancer.\nKeeping the applications healthy\nOnce the application is up and running, the Kubelet keeps the application healthy by restarting it when it terminates. It also reports the status of the application by updating the object that represents the application instance. The other controllers monitor these objects and ensure that applications are moved to healthy nodes if their nodes fail.\nYou’re now roughly familiar with the architecture and functionality of Kubernetes. You don’t need to understand or remember all the details at this moment, because internalizing this information will be easier when you learn about each individual object types and the controllers that bring them to life in the second part of the book.\n"},"docs/Introducing_Kubernetes_into_your_organization.html":{"url":"docs/Introducing_Kubernetes_into_your_organization.html","title":"1.3 Introducing Kubernetes into your organization","keywords":"","body":"Introducing Kubernetes into your organization\nTo close this chapter, let’s see what options are available to you if you decide to introduce Kubernetes in your own IT environment.\nRunning Kubernetes on-premises and in the cloud\nIf you want to run your applications on Kubernetes, you have to decide whether you want to run them locally, in your organization’s own infrastructure (on-premises) or with one of the major cloud providers, or perhaps both - in a hybrid cloud solution.\nRunning Kubernetes on-premises\nRunning Kubernetes on your own infrastructure may be your only option if regulations require you to run applications on site. This usually means that you’ll have to manage Kubernetes yourself, but we’ll come to that later.\nKubernetes can run directly on your bare-metal machines or in virtual machines running in your data center. In either case, you won’t be able to scale your cluster as easily as when you run it in virtual machines provided by a cloud provider.\nDeploying Kubernetes in the cloud\nIf you have no on-premises infrastructure, you have no choice but to run Kubernetes in the cloud. This has the advantage that you can scale your cluster at any time at short notice if required. As mentioned earlier, Kubernetes itself can ask the cloud provider to provision additional virtual machines when the current size of the cluster is no longer sufficient to run all the applications you want to deploy.\nWhen the number of workloads decreases and some worker nodes are left without running workloads, Kubernetes can ask the cloud provider to destroy the virtual machines of these nodes to reduce your operational costs. This elasticity of the cluster is certainly one of the main benefits of running Kubernetes in the cloud.\nUsing a hybrid cloud solution\nA more complex option is to run Kubernetes on-premises, but also allow it to spill over into the cloud. It’s possible to configure Kubernetes to provision additional nodes in the cloud if you exceed the capacity of your own data center. This way, you get the best of both worlds. Most of the time, your applications run locally without the cost of virtual machine rental, but in short periods of peak load that may occur only a few times a year, your applications can handle the extra load by using the additional resources in the cloud.\nIf your use-case requires it, you can also run a Kubernetes cluster across multiple cloud providers or a combination of any of the options mentioned. This can be done using a single control plane or one control plane in each location.\nTo manage or not to manage Kubernetes yourself\nIf you are considering introducing Kubernetes in your organization, the most important question you need to answer is whether you’ll manage Kubernetes yourself or use a Kubernetes-as-a-Service type offering where someone else manages it for you.\nManaging Kubernetes yourself\nIf you already run applications on-premises and have enough hardware to run a production-ready Kubernetes cluster, your first instinct is probably to deploy and manage it yourself. If you ask anyone in the Kubernetes community if this is a good idea, you’ll usually get a very definite “no”.\nFigure 1.14 was a very simplified representation of what happens in a Kubernetes cluster when you deploy an application. Even that figure should have scared you. Kubernetes brings with it an enormous amount of additional complexity. Anyone who wants to run a Kubernetes cluster must be intimately familiar with its inner workings.\nThe management of production-ready Kubernetes clusters is a multi-billion-dollar industry. Before you decide to manage one yourself, it’s essential that you consult with engineers who have already done it to learn about the issues most teams run into. If you don’t, you may be setting yourself up for failure. On the other hand, trying out Kubernetes for non-production use-cases or using a managed Kubernetes cluster is much less problematic.\nUsing a managed Kubernetes cluster in the cloud\nUsing Kubernetes is ten times easier than managing it. Most major cloud providers now offer Kubernetes-as-a-Service. They take care of managing Kubernetes and its components while you simply use the Kubernetes API like any of the other APIs the cloud provider offers.\nThe top managed Kubernetes offerings include the following:\n\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\nAzure Kubernetes Service (AKS)\nAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)\nIBM Cloud Kubernetes Service\nRed Hat OpenShift Online and Dedicated\nVMware Cloud PKS\nAlibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK)\n\nThe first half of this book focuses on just using Kubernetes. You’ll run the exercises in a local development cluster and on a managed GKE cluster, as I find it’s the easiest to use and offers the best user experience. The second part of the book gives you a solid foundation for managing Kubernetes, but to truly master it, you’ll need to gain additional experience.\nUsing vanilla or extended Kubernetes\nThe final question is whether to use a vanilla open-source version of Kubernetes or an extended, enterprise-quality Kubernetes product.\nUsing a vanilla version of Kubernetes\nThe open-source version of Kubernetes is maintained by the community and represents the cutting edge of Kubernetes development. This also means that it may not be as stable as the other options. It may also lack good security defaults. Deploying the vanilla version requires a lot of fine tuning to set everything up for production use.\nUsing enterprise-grade Kubernetes distributions\nA better option for using Kubernetes in production is to use an enterprise-quality Kubernetes distribution such as OpenShift or Rancher. In addition to the increased security and performance provided by better defaults, they offer additional object types in addition to those provided in the upstream Kubernetes API. For example, vanilla Kubernetes does not contain object types that represent cluster users, whereas commercial distributions do. They also provide additional software tools for deploying and managing well-known third-party applications on Kubernetes.\nOf course, extending and hardening Kubernetes takes time, so these commercial Kubernetes distributions usually lag one or two versions behind the upstream version of Kubernetes. It’s not as bad as it sounds. The benefits usually outweigh the disadvantages.\nShould you even use Kubernetes?\nI hope this chapter has made you excited about Kubernetes and you can’t wait to squeeze it into your IT stack. But to close this chapter properly, we need to say a word or two about when introducing Kubernetes is not a good idea.\nDo your workloads require automated management?\nThe first thing you need to be honest about is whether you need to automate the management of your applications at all. If your application is a large monolith, you definitely don’t need Kubernetes.\nEven if you deploy microservices, using Kubernetes may not be the best option, especially if the number of your microservices is very small. It’s difficult to provide an exact number when the scales tip over, since other factors also influence the decision. But if your system consists of less than five microservices, throwing Kubernetes into the mix is probably not a good idea. If your system has more than twenty microservices, you will most likely benefit from the integration of Kubernetes. If the number of your microservices falls somewhere in between, other factors, such as the ones described next, should be considered.\nCan you afford to invest your engineers’ time into learning Kubernetes?\nKubernetes is designed to allow applications to run without them knowing that they are running in Kubernetes. While the applications themselves don’t need to be modified to run in Kubernetes, development engineers will inevitably spend a lot of time learning how to use Kubernetes, even though the operators are the only ones that actually need that knowledge.\nIt would be hard to tell your teams that you’re switching to Kubernetes and expect only the operations team to start exploring it. Developers like shiny new things. At the time of writing, Kubernetes is still a very shiny thing.\nAre you prepared for increased costs in the interim?\nWhile Kubernetes reduces long-term operational costs, introducing Kubernetes in your organization initially involves increased costs for training, hiring new engineers, building and purchasing new tools and possibly additional hardware. Kubernetes requires additional computing resources in addition to the resources that the applications use.\nDon’t believe the hype\nAlthough Kubernetes has been around for several years at the time of writing this book, I can’t say that the hype phase is over. The initial excitement has just begun to calm down, but many engineers may still be unable to make rational decisions about whether the integration of Kubernetes is as necessary as it seems.\n"},"docs/Summary_1.html":{"url":"docs/Summary_1.html","title":"1.4 Summary","keywords":"","body":"Summary\nIn this introductory chapter, you’ve learned that:\n\nKubernetes is Greek for helmsman.

Kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool, is pronounced kube-control.\nKubernetes is an open-source project built upon Google’s vast experience in running applications on a global scale. Thousands of individuals now contribute to it.\nKubernetes uses a declarative model to describe application deployments. After you provide a description of your application to Kubernetes, it brings it to life.\nKubernetes is like an operating system for the cluster. It abstracts the infrastructure and presents all computers in a data center as one large, contiguous deployment area.\nMicroservice-based applications are more difficult to manage than monolithic applications. The more microservices you have, the more you need to automate their management with a system like Kubernetes.\nKubernetes helps both development and operations teams to do what they do best. It frees them from mundane tasks and introduces a standard way of deploying applications both on-premises and in any cloud.\nUsing Kubernetes allows developers to deploy applications without the help of system administrators. It reduces operational costs through better utilization of existing hardware, automatically adjusts your system to load fluctuations, and heals itself and the applications running on it.\nA Kubernetes cluster consists of master and worker nodes. The master nodes run the Control Plane, which controls the entire cluster, while the worker nodes run the deployed applications or workloads, and therefore represent the Workload Plane.\nUsing Kubernetes is simple, but managing it is hard. An inexperienced team should use a Kubernetes-as-a-Service offering instead of deploying Kubernetes by itself.\n\nSo far, you’ve only observed the ship from the pier. It’s time to come aboard.

But as the microservices become smaller and their numbers start to grow, you may not be able to afford to give each one its own VM if you want to keep your hardware costs low and not waste resources.\nIt’s not just a matter of wasting hardware resources - each VM typically needs to be individually configured and managed, which means that running higher numbers of VMs also results in higher staffing requirements and the need for a better, often more complicated automation system. Due to the shift to microservice architectures, where systems consist of hundreds of deployed application instances, an alternative to VMs was needed. Containers are that alternative.\nComparing containers to virtual machines\nInstead of using virtual machines to isolate the environments of individual microservices (or software processes in general), most development and operations teams now prefer to use containers. They allow you to run multiple services on the same host computer, while keeping them isolated from each other. Like VMs, but with much less overhead.\nUnlike VMs, which each run a separate operating system with several system processes, a process running in a container runs within the existing host operating system. Because there is only one operating system, no duplicate system processes exist. Although all the application processes run in the same operating system, their environments are isolated, though not as well as when you run them in separate VMs. To the process in the container, this isolation makes it look like no other processes exist on the computer. You’ll learn how this is possible in the next few sections, but first let’s dive deeper into the differences between containers and virtual machines.\nComparing the overhead of containers and virtual machines\nCompared to VMs, containers are much lighter, because they don’t require a separate resource pool or any additional OS-level processes. While each VM  usually runs its own set of system processes, which requires additional computing resources in addition to those consumed by the user application’s own process, a container is nothing more than an isolated process running in the existing host OS that consumes only the resources the app consumes. They have virtually no overhead.\nFigure 2.1 shows two bare metal computers, one running two virtual machines, and the other running containers instead. The latter has space for additional containers, as it runs only one operating system, while the first runs three – one host and two guest OSes.\nFigure 2.1 Using VMs to isolate groups of applications vs. isolating individual apps with containers\n\nBecause of the resource overhead of VMs, you often group multiple applications into each VM. You can’t afford to dedicate a whole VM to each app. But containers introduce no overhead, which means you can afford to create a separate container for each application. In fact, you should never run multiple applications in the same container, as this makes managing the processes in the container much more difficult. Moreover, all existing software dealing with containers, including Kubernetes itself, is designed under the premise that there’s only one application in a container.\nComparing the start-up time of containers and virtual machines\nIn addition to the lower runtime overhead, containers also start the application faster, because only the application process itself needs to be started. No additional system processes need to be started first, as is the case when booting up a new virtual machine.\nComparing the isolation of containers and virtual machines\nYou’ll agree that containers are clearly better when it comes to the use of resources, but there’s also a disadvantage. When you run applications in virtual machines, each VM runs its own operating system and kernel. Underneath those VMs is the hypervisor (and possibly an additional operating system), which splits the physical hardware resources into smaller sets of virtual resources that the operating system in each VM can use. As figure 2.2 shows, applications running in these VMs make system calls (sys-calls) to the guest OS kernel in the VM, and the machine instructions that the kernel then executes on the virtual CPUs are then forwarded to the host’s physical CPU via the hypervisor.\nFigure 2.2 How apps use the hardware when running in a VM vs. in a container\n\nNOTE \nTwo types of hypervisors exist. Type 1 hypervisors don’t require running a host OS, while type 2 hypervisors do.\n\nContainers, on the other hand, all make system calls on the single kernel running in the host OS. This single kernel is the only one that executes instructions on the host’s CPU. The CPU doesn’t need to handle any kind of virtualization the way it does with VMs.\nExamine figure 2.3 to see the difference between running three applications on bare metal, running them in two separate virtual machines, or running them in three containers.\nFigure 2.3 The difference between running applications on bare metal, in virtual machines, and in containers\n\nIn the first case, all three applications use the same kernel and aren’t isolated at all. In the second case, applications A and B run in the same VM and thus share the kernel, while application C is completely isolated from the other two, since it uses its own kernel. It only shares the hardware with the first two.\nThe third case shows the same three applications running in containers. Although they all use the same kernel, they are isolated from each other and completely unaware of the others’ existence. The isolation is provided by the kernel itself. Each application sees only a part of the physical hardware and sees itself as the only process running in the OS, although they all run in the same OS.\nUnderstanding the security-implications of container isolation\nThe main advantage of using virtual machines over containers is the complete isolation they provide, since each VM has its own Linux kernel, while containers all use the same kernel. This can clearly pose a security risk. If there’s a bug in the kernel, an application in one container might use it to read the memory of applications in other containers. If the apps run in different VMs and therefore share only the hardware, the probability of such attacks is much lower. Of course, complete isolation is only achieved by running applications on separate physical machines.\nAdditionally, containers share memory space, whereas each VM uses its own chunk of memory. Therefore, if you don’t limit the amount of memory that a container can use, this could cause other containers to run out of memory or cause their data to be swapped out to disk.\nNOTE\nThis can’t happen in Kubernetes, because it requires that swap is disabled on all the nodes.\n\nUnderstanding what enables containers and what enables virtual machines\nWhile virtual machines are enabled through virtualization support in the CPU and by virtualization software on the host, containers are enabled by the Linux kernel itself. You’ll learn about container technologies later when you can try them out for yourself. You’ll need to have Docker installed for that, so let’s learn how it fits into the container story.\nIntroducing the Docker container platform\nWhile container technologies have existed for a long time, they only became widely known with the rise of Docker. Docker was the first container system that made them easily portable across different computers. It simplified the process of packaging up the application and all its libraries and other dependencies - even the entire OS file system - into a simple, portable package that can be used to deploy the application on any computer running Docker.\nIntroducing containers, images and registries\nDocker is a platform for packaging, distributing and running applications. As mentioned earlier, it allows you to package your application along with its entire environment. This can be just a few dynamically linked libraries required by the app, or all the files that are usually shipped with an operating system. Docker allows you to distribute this package via a public repository to any other Docker-enabled computer.\nFigure 2.4 The three main Docker concepts are images, registries and containers\n\n"},"docs/Introducing_the_Kubernetes_API_Objects.html":{"url":"docs/Introducing_the_Kubernetes_API_Objects.html","title":"4.

They include the applications running in the cluster, their configuration, the load balancers through which they are exposed within the cluster or externally, the underlying servers and the storage used by these applications, the security privileges of users and applications, and many other details of the infrastructure.\nFigure 4.1 A Kubernetes cluster is configured by manipulating objects in the Kubernetes API\n\nIntroducing the API\nThe Kubernetes API is the central point of interaction with the cluster, so much of this book is dedicated to explaining this API. The most important API objects are described in the following chapters, but a basic introduction to the API is presented here.\nUnderstanding the architectural style of the API\nThe Kubernetes API is an HTTP-based RESTful API where the state is represented by resources on which you perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using standard HTTP methods such as POST, GET, PUT/PATCH or DELETE.\nDEFINITION\nREST is Representational State Transfer, an architectural style for implementing interoperability between computer systems via web services using stateless operations, described by Roy Thomas Fielding in his doctoral dissertation. To learn more, read the dissertation at https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm.\n\nIt is these resources (or objects) that represent the configuration of the cluster. Cluster administrators and engineers who deploy applications into the cluster therefore influence the configuration by manipulating these objects.\nIn the Kubernetes community, the terms “resource” and “object” are used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences that warrant an explanation.\nUnderstanding the difference between resources and objects\nThe essential concept in RESTful APIs is the resource, and each resource is assigned a URI or Uniform Resource Identifier that uniquely identifies it. For example, in the Kubernetes API, application deployments are represented by deployment resources.\nThe collection of all deployments in the cluster is a REST resource exposed at /api/v1/deployments. When you use the GET method to send an HTTP request to this URI, you receive a response that lists all deployment instances in the cluster.\nEach individual deployment instance also has its own unique URI through which it can be manipulated. The individual deployment is thus exposed as another REST resource. You can retrieve information about the deployment by sending a GET request to the resource URI and you can modify it using a PUT request.\nFigure 4.2 A single object can be exposed by two or more resources\n\nAn object can therefore be exposed through more than one resource. As shown in figure 4.2, the Deployment object instance named mydeploy is returned both as an element of a collection when you query the deployments resource and as a single object when you query the individual resource URI directly.\nIn addition, a single object instance can also be exposed via multiple resources if multiple API versions exist for an object type. Up to Kubernetes version 1.15, two different representations of Deployment objects were exposed by the API. In addition to the apps/v1 version, exposed at /apis/apps/v1/deployments, an older version, extensions/v1beta1, exposed at /apis/extensions/v1beta1/deployments was available in the API. These two resources didn’t represent two different sets of Deployment objects, but a single set that was represented in two different ways - with small differences in the object schema. You could create an instance of a Deployment object via the first URI and then read it back using the second.\nIn some cases, a resource doesn’t represent any object at all. An example of this is the way the Kubernetes API allows clients to verify whether a subject (a person or a service) is authorized to perform an API operation. This is done by submitting a POST request to the /apis/authorization.k8s.io/v1/subjectaccessreviews resource. The response indicates whether the subject is authorized to perform the operation specified in the request body. The key thing here is that no object is created by the POST request.\nThe examples described above show that a resource isn’t the same as an object. If you are familiar with relational database systems, you can compare resources and object types with views and tables. Resources are views through which you interact with objects.\nNOTE\nBecause the term “resource” can also refer to compute resources, such as CPU and memory, to reduce confusion, the term “objects” is used in this book to refer to API resources.\n\nUnderstanding how objects are represented\nWhen you make a GET request for a resource, the Kubernetes API server returns the object in structured text form. The default data model is JSON, but you can also tell the server to return YAML instead. When you update the object using a POST or PUT request, you also specify the new state with either JSON or YAML.\nThe individual fields in an object’s manifest depend on the object type, but the general structure and many fields are shared by all Kubernetes API objects. You’ll learn about them next.\nUnderstanding the structure of an object manifest\nBefore you are confronted with the complete manifest of a Kubernetes object, let me first explain its major parts, because this will help you to find your way through the sometimes hundreds of lines it is composed of.\nIntroducing the main parts of an object\nThe manifest of most Kubernetes API objects consists of the following four sections:\n\nType Metadata contains information about the type of object this manifest describes. It specifies the object type, the group to which the type belongs, and the API version.\nObject Metadata holds the basic information about the object instance, including its name, time of creation, owner of the object, and other identifying information. The fields in the Object Metadata are the same for all object types.\nSpec is the part in which you specify the desired state of the object. Its fields differ between different object types. For pods, this is the part that specifies the pod’s containers, storage volumes and other information related to its operation.\nStatus contains the current actual state of the object. For a pod, it tells you the condition of the pod, the status of each of its containers, its IP address, the node it’s running on, and other information that reveals what’s happening to your pod.\n\nA visual representation of an object manifest and its four sections is shown in the next figure.\nFigure 4.3 The main sections of a Kubernetes API object.\n\nNOTE\nAlthough the figure shows that users write to the object’s Spec section and read its Status, the API server always returns the entire object when you perform a GET request; to update the object, you also send the entire object in the PUT request.\n\nYou’ll see an example later to see which fields exist in these sections but let me first explain the Spec and Status sections, as they represent the flesh of the object.\nUnderstanding the spec and status sections\nAs you may have noticed in the previous figure, the two most important parts of an object are the Spec and Status sections. You use the Spec to specify the desired state of the object and read the actual state of the object from the Status section. So, you are the one who writes the Spec and reads the Status, but who or what reads the Spec and writes the Status?\nThe Kubernetes Control Plane runs several components called controllers that manage the objects you create. Each controller is usually only responsible for one object type. For example, the Deployment controller manages Deployment objects.\nAs shown in figure 4.4, the task of a controller is to read the desired object state from the object’s Spec section, perform the actions required to achieve this state, and report back the actual state of the object by writing to its Status section.\nFigure 4.4 How a controller manages an object\n\nEssentially, you tell Kubernetes what it has to do by creating and updating API objects. Kubernetes controllers use the same API objects to tell you what they have done and what the status of their work is.\nYou’ll learn more about the individual controllers and their responsibilities in chapter 13. For now, just remember that a controller is associated with most object types and that the controller is the thing that reads the Spec and writes the Status of the object.\nNot all objects have the spec and status sections\nAll Kubernetes API objects contain the two metadata sections, but not all have the Spec and Status sections. Those that don’t, typically contain just static data and don’t have a corresponding controller, so it is not necessary to distinguish between the desired and the actual state of the object.\nAn example of such an object is the Event object, which is created by various controllers to provide additional information about what is happening with an object that the controller is managing. The Event object is explained in section 4.3.\nYou now understand the general outline of an object, so the next section of this chapter can finally explore the individual fields of an object.\n"},"docs/Examining_an_objects_individual_properties.html":{"url":"docs/Examining_an_objects_individual_properties.html","title":"4.2 Examining an object’s individual properties","keywords":"","body":"Examining an object’s individual properties\nTo examine Kubernetes API objects up close, we’ll need a concrete example. Let’s take the Node object, which should be easy to understand because it represents something you might be relatively familiar with - a computer in the cluster.\nMy Kubernetes cluster provisioned by the kind tool has three nodes - one master and two workers. They are represented by three Node objects in the API. I can query the API and list these objects using kubectl get nodes, as shown in the next listing.\nListing 4.1 Listing Node objects\n$ kubectl get nodes\nNAME                 STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION\nkind-control-plane   Ready    master   1h     v1.18.2\nkind-worker          Ready       1h     v1.18.2\nkind-worker2         Ready       1h     v1.18.2\n\nThe following figure shows the three Node objects and the actual cluster machines that make up the cluster. Each Node object instance represents one host. In each instance, the Spec section contains (part of) the configuration of the host, and the Status section contains the state of the host.\nFigure 4.5 Cluster nodes are represented by Node objects\n\nNOTE\nNode objects are slightly different from other objects because they are usually created by the Kubelet - the node agent running on the cluster node - rather than by users. When you add a machine to the cluster, the Kubelet registers the node by creating a Node object that represents the host. Users can then edit (some of) the fields in the Spec section.\n\nExploring the full manifest of a Node object\nLet’s take a close look at one of the Node objects. List all Node objects in your cluster by running the kubectl get nodes command and select one you want to inspect. Then, execute the kubectl get node  -o yaml command, where you replace  with the name of the node, as shown in the following listing.\nListing 4.2 Displaying the complete YAML manifest of an object\n$ kubectl get node kind-control-plane -o yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Node\nmetadata:\n  annotations: ...\n  creationTimestamp: \"2020-05-03T15:09:17Z\"\n  labels: ...\n  managedFields: ...\n  name: kind-control-plane                                    #C\n  resourceVersion: \"3220054\"\n  selfLink: /api/v1/nodes/kind-control-plane\n  uid: 16dc1e0b-8d34-4cfb-8ade-3b0e91ec838b\nspec:\n  podCIDR: 10.244.0.0/24                                      #E\n  podCIDRs:                                                   #E\n  - 10.244.0.0/24                                             #E\n  taints:\n  - effect: NoSchedule\n    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master\nstatus:\n  addresses:                                                  #G\n  - address: 172.18.0.2                                       #G\n    type: InternalIP                                          #G\n  - address: kind-control-plane                               #G\n    type: Hostname                                            #G\n  allocatable: ...\n  capacity:                                                   #H\n    cpu: \"8\"                                                  #H\n    ephemeral-storage: 401520944Ki                            #H\n    hugepages-1Gi: \"0\"                                        #H\n    hugepages-2Mi: \"0\"                                        #H\n    memory: 32720824Ki                                        #H\n    pods: \"110\"                                               #H\n  conditions:\n  - lastHeartbeatTime: \"2020-05-17T12:28:41Z\"\n    lastTransitionTime: \"2020-05-03T15:09:17Z\"\n    message: kubelet has sufficient memory available\n    reason: KubeletHasSufficientMemory\n    status: \"False\"\n    type: MemoryPressure\n    ...\n  daemonEndpoints:\n    kubeletEndpoint:\n      Port: 10250\n  images:                                                     #I\n  - names:                                                    #I\n    - k8s.gcr.io/etcd:3.4.3-0                                 #I\n    sizeBytes: 289997247                                      #I\n    ...                                                       #I\n  nodeInfo:                                                   #J\n    architecture: amd64                                       #J\n    bootID: 233a359f-5897-4860-863d-06546130e1ff              #J\n    containerRuntimeVersion: containerd://1.3.3-14-g449e9269  #J\n    kernelVersion: 5.5.10-200.fc31.x86_64                     #J\n    kubeProxyVersion: v1.18.2                                 #J\n    kubeletVersion: v1.18.2                                   #J\n    machineID: 74b74e389bb246e99abdf731d145142d               #J\n    operatingSystem: linux                                    #J\n    osImage: Ubuntu 19.10                                     #J\n    systemUUID: 8749f818-8269-4a02-bdc2-84bf5fa21700          #J\n\nNOTE\nUse the -o json option to display the object in JSON instead of YAML.\n\nIn the listing, the four main sections of the object definition and the more important properties of the node are annotated to help you distinguish between the more and less important fields. Some lines have been omitted to reduce the length of the manifest.\nAccessing the API directly\nYou may be interested in trying to access the API directly instead of through kubectl. As explained earlier, the Kubernetes API is web based, so you can use a web browser or the curl command to perform API operations, but the API server uses TLS and you typically need a client certificate or token for authentication. Fortunately, kubectl provides a special proxy that takes care of this, allowing you to talk to the API through the proxy using plain HTTP.\nTo run the proxy, execute the command:\n$ kubectl proxy\n\nStarting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8001\nYou can now access the API using HTTP at 127.0.0.1:8001. For example, to retrieve the node object, open the URL http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/nodes/kind-control-plane (replace kind-control-plane with one of your nodes’ names).\nNow let’s take a closer look at the fields in each of the four main sections.\nThe Type Metadata fields\nAs you can see, the listing starts with the apiVersion and kind fields, which specify the API version and type of the object that this object manifest specifies. The API version is the schema used to describe this object. As mentioned before, an object type can be associated with more than one schema, with different fields in each schema being used to describe the object. However, usually only one schema exists for each type.\nThe apiVersion in the previous listing is simply v1, but you’ll see in the following chapters that the apiVersion in other object types contains more than just the version number. For Deployment objects, for example, the apiVersion is apps/v1. Whereas the field was originally used only to specify the API version, it is now also used to specify the API group to which the resource belongs. Node objects belong to the core API group, which is conventionally omitted from the apiVersion field.\nThe type of object defined in the manifest is specified by the field kind. The object kind in the previous listing is Node, and so far in this book you’ve also dealt with the following kinds: Deployment, Service, and Pod.\nFields in the Object Metadata section\nThe metadata section contains the metadata of this object instance. It contains the name of the instance, along with additional attributes such as labels and annotations, which are explained in chapter 9, and fields such as resourceVersion, managedFields, and other low-level fields, which are explained at depth in chapter 12.\nFields in the Spec section\nNext comes the spec section, which is specific to each object kind. It is relatively short for Node objects compared to what you find for other object kinds. The podCIDR fields specify the pod IP range assigned to the node. Pods running on this node are assigned IPs from this range. The taints field is not important at this point, but you’ll learn about it in chapter 18.\nTypically, an object’s spec section contains many more fields that you use to configure the object.\nFields in the Status section\nThe status section also differs between the different kinds of object, but its purpose is always the same - it contains the last observed state of the thing the object represents. For Node objects, the status reveals the node’s IP address(es), host name, capacity to provide compute resources, the current conditions of the node, the container images it has already downloaded and which are now cached locally, and information about its operating system and the version of Kubernetes components running on it.\nUnderstanding individual object fields\nTo learn more about individual fields in the manifest, you can refer to the API reference documentation at http://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/ or use the kubectl explain command as described next.\nUsing kubectl explain to explore API object fields\nThe kubectl tool has a nice feature that allows you to look up the explanation of each field for each object type (kind) from the command line. Usually, you start by asking it to provide the basic description of the object kind by running kubectl explain , as shown here:\nListing 4.3 Using kubectl explain to learn about an object kind\n$ kubectl explain nodes\nKIND:     Node\nVERSION:  v1\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n     Node is a worker node in Kubernetes. Each node will have a unique\n     identifier in the cache (i.e. in etcd).\n\nFIELDS:\n   apiVersion   \n     APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an\n     object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest...\n\n   kind \n     Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object\n     represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client...\n\n   metadata     \n     Standard object's metadata. More info: ...\n\n   spec \n     Spec defines the behavior of a node...\n\n   status       \n     Most recently observed status of the node. Populated by the system.\n     Read-only. More info: ...\n\nThe command prints the explanation of the object and lists the top-level fields that the object can contain.\nDrilling deeper into an API object’s structure\nYou can then drill deeper to find subfields under each specific field. For example, you can use the following command to explain the node’s spec field:\nListing 4.4 Using kubectl explain to learn about a specific object field and sub-fields\n$ kubectl explain node.spec\nKIND:     Node\nVERSION:  v1\n\nRESOURCE: spec \n\nDESCRIPTION:\n     Spec defines the behavior of a node.\n\n     NodeSpec describes the attributes that a node is created with.\n\nFIELDS:\n   configSource \n     If specified, the source to get node configuration from The\n     DynamicKubeletConfig feature gate must be enabled for the Kubelet...\n\n   externalID   \n     Deprecated. Not all kubelets will set this field...\n\n   podCIDR      \n     PodCIDR represents the pod IP range assigned to the node.    \n\n   ...\n\nPlease note the API version given at the top. As explained earlier, multiple versions of the same kind can exist. Different versions can have different fields or default values. If you want to display a different version, specify it with the --api-version option.\nNOTE\nIf you want to see the complete structure of an object (the complete hierarchical list of fields without the descriptions), try kubectl explain pods --recursive.\n\nUnderstanding an object’s status conditions\nThe set of fields in both the spec and status sections is different for each object kind, but the conditions field is found in many of them. It gives a list of conditions the object is currently in. They are very useful when you need to troubleshoot an object, so let’s examine them more closely. Since the Node object is used as an example, this section also teaches you how to easily identify problems with a cluster node.\nIntroducing the node’s status conditions\nLet’s print out the YAML manifest of the one of the node objects again, but this time we’ll only focus on the conditions field in the object’s status, as shown in the following listing.\nListing 4.5 The current status conditions in a Node object\n$ kubectl get node kind-control-plane -o yaml\n...\nstatus:\n  ...\n  conditions:\n  - lastHeartbeatTime: \"2020-05-17T13:03:42Z\"\n    lastTransitionTime: \"2020-05-03T15:09:17Z\"\n    message: kubelet has sufficient memory available\n    reason: KubeletHasSufficientMemory\n    status: \"False\"\n    type: MemoryPressure\n  - lastHeartbeatTime: \"2020-05-17T13:03:42Z\"\n    lastTransitionTime: \"2020-05-03T15:09:17Z\"\n    message: kubelet has no disk pressure\n    reason: KubeletHasNoDiskPressure\n    status: \"False\"\n    type: DiskPressure\n  - lastHeartbeatTime: \"2020-05-17T13:03:42Z\"\n    lastTransitionTime: \"2020-05-03T15:09:17Z\"\n    message: kubelet has sufficient PID available\n    reason: KubeletHasSufficientPID\n    status: \"False\"\n    type: PIDPressure\n  - lastHeartbeatTime: \"2020-05-17T13:03:42Z\"\n    lastTransitionTime: \"2020-05-03T15:10:15Z\"\n    message: kubelet is posting ready status\n    reason: KubeletReady\n    status: \"True\"\n    type: Ready\n\nTIP\nThe jq tool is very handy if you want to see only a part of the object’s structure. For example, to display the node’s status conditions, you can run kubectl get node  -o json | jq .status.conditions. The equivalent tool for YAML is yq.\n\nThere are four conditions that reveal the state of the node. Each condition has a type and a status field, which can be True, False or Unknown, as shown in the figure 4.6. A condition can also specify a machine-facing reason for the last transition of the condition and a human-facing message with details about the transition. The lastTransitionTime field indicates when the condition moved from one status to another, whereas the lastHeartbeatTime field reveals the last time the controller received an update on the given condition.\nFigure 4.6 The status conditions indicating the state of a Node object\n\nAlthough it’s the last condition in the list, the Ready condition is probably the most important, as it signals whether the node is ready to accept new workloads (pods). The other conditions (MemoryPressure, DiskPressure and PIDPressure) signal whether the node is running out of resources. Remember to check these conditions if a node starts to behave strangely - for example, if the applications running on it start running out of resources and/or crash.\nUnderstanding conditions in other object kinds\nA condition list such as that in Node objects is also used in many other object kinds. The conditions explained earlier are a good example of why the state of most objects is represented by multiple conditions instead of a single field.\nNOTE\nConditions are usually orthogonal, meaning that they represent unrelated aspects of the object.\n\nIf the state of an object were represented as a single field, it would be very difficult to subsequently extend it with new values, as this would require updating all clients that monitor the state of the object and perform actions based on it. Some object kinds originally used such a single field, and some still do, but most now use a list of conditions instead.\nSince the focus of this chapter is to introduce the common features of the Kubernetes API objects, we’ve focused only on the conditions field, but it is far from being the only field in the status of the Node object. To explore the others, use the kubectl explain command as described in the previous sidebar. The fields that are not immediately easy for you to understand should become clear to you after reading the remaining chapters in this part of the book.\nNOTE\nAs an exercise, use the command kubectl get   -o yaml to explore the other objects you’ve created so far (deployments, services, and pods).\n\nInspecting objects using the kubectl describe command\nTo give you a correct impression of the entire structure of the Kubernetes API objects, it was necessary to show you the complete YAML manifest of an object. While I personally often use this method to inspect an object, a more user-friendly way to inspect an object is the kubectl describe command, which typically displays the same information or sometimes even more.\nUnderstanding the kubectl describe output for a Node object\nLet’s try running the kubectl describe command on a Node object. To keep things interesting, let’s now take one of the worker nodes instead of the master. The following listing shows what the kubectl describe command displays for one of my two worker nodes.\nListing 4.6 Inspecting a Node object with kubectl describe\n$ kubectl describe node kind-worker-2\nName:               kind-worker2\nRoles:              \nLabels:             beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64\n                    beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux\n                    kubernetes.io/arch=amd64\n                    kubernetes.io/hostname=kind-worker2\n                    kubernetes.io/os=linux\nAnnotations:        kubeadm.alpha.kubernetes.io/cri-socket: /run/contain...\n                    node.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl: 0\n                    volumes.kubernetes.io/controller-managed-attach-deta...\nCreationTimestamp:  Sun, 03 May 2020 17:09:48 +0200\nTaints:             \nUnschedulable:      false\nLease:\n  HolderIdentity:  kind-worker2\n  AcquireTime:     \n  RenewTime:       Sun, 17 May 2020 16:15:03 +0200\nConditions:\n  Type             Status  ...

You can see the name, IP address, and hostname, as well as the conditions and available capacity of the node.\nInspecting other objects related to the Node\nIn addition to the information stored in the Node object itself, the kubectl describe command also displays the pods running on the node and the total amount of compute resources allocated to them. Below is also a list of events related to the node.\nThis additional information isn’t found in the Node object itself, but is collected by the kubectl tool from other API objects. For example, the list of pods running on the node is obtained by retrieving Pod objects via the pods resource.\nIf you run the describe command yourself, no events may be displayed. This is because only events that have occurred recently are shown. For Node objects, unless the node has resource capacity issues, you’ll only see events if you’ve recently (re)started the node.\nVirtually every API object kind has events associated with it. Since they are crucial for debugging a cluster, they warrant a closer look before you start exploring other objects.\n"},"docs/Observing_cluster_events_via_Event_objects.html":{"url":"docs/Observing_cluster_events_via_Event_objects.html","title":"4.3 Observing cluster events via Event objects","keywords":"","body":"Observing cluster events via Event objects\nAs controllers perform their task of reconciling the actual state of an object with the desired state, as specified in the object’s spec field, they generate events to reveal what they have done. Two types of events exist: Normal and Warning. Events of the latter type are usually generated by controllers when something prevents them from reconciling the object. By monitoring this type of events, you can be quickly informed of any problems that the cluster encounters.\nIntroducing the Event object\nLike everything else in Kubernetes, events are represented by Event objects that are created and read via the Kubernetes API. As the following figure shows, they contain information about what happened to the object and what the source of the event was. Unlike other objects, each Event object is deleted one hour after its creation to reduce the burden on etcd, the data store for Kubernetes API objects.\nFigure 4.7 The relationship between Event objects, controllers, and other API objects.\n\nNOTE\nThe amount of time to retain events is configurable via the API server’s command-line options.\n\nListing events using kubectl get events\nThe events displayed by kubectl describe refer to the object you specify as the argument to the command. Due to their nature and the fact that many events can be created for an object in a short time, they aren’t part of the object itself. You won’t find them in the object’s YAML manifest, as they exist on their own, just like Nodes and the other objects you’ve seen so far.\nNOTE\nIf you want to follow the exercises in this section in your own cluster, you may need to restart one of the nodes to ensure that the events are recent enough to still be present in etcd. If you can’t do this, don’t worry, and just skip doing these exercises yourself, as you’ll also be generating and inspecting events in the exercises in the next chapter.\n\nBecause Events are standalone objects, you can list them using kubectl get events, as shown in the next listing.\nListing 4.7 Listing events using kubectl get events\n$ kubectl get ev\nLAST\nSEEN  TYPE    REASON                   OBJECT             MESSAGE\n48s   Normal  Starting                 node/kind-worker2  Starting kubelet.\n48s   Normal  NodeAllocatableEnforced  node/kind-worker2  Updated Node A...\n48s   Normal  NodeHasSufficientMemory  node/kind-worker2  Node kind-work...\n48s   Normal  NodeHasNoDiskPressure    node/kind-worker2  Node kind-work...\n48s   Normal  NodeHasSufficientPID     node/kind-worker2  Node kind-work...\n47s   Normal  Starting                 node/kind-worker2  Starting kube-...\n\nNOTE\nThe previous listing uses the short name ev in place of events.\n\nYou’ll notice that some events displayed in the listing match the status conditions of the Node. This is often the case, but you’ll also find additional events. The two events with the reason Starting are two such examples. In the case at hand, they signal that the Kubelet and the Kube Proxy components have been started on the node. You don’t need to worry about these components yet. They are explained in the third part of the book.\nUnderstanding what’s in an Event object\nAs with other objects, the kubectl get command only outputs the most important object data. To display additional information, you can enable additional columns by executing the command with the -o wide option:\n$ kubectl get ev -o wide\n\nThe output of this command is extremely wide and is not listed here in the book. Instead, the information that is displayed is explained in the following table.\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nName\nThe name of this Event object instance. Useful only if you want to retrieve the given object from the API.\n\n\nType\nThe type of the event. Either Normal or Warning.\n\n\nReason\nThe machine-facing description why the event occurred.\n\n\nSource\nThe component that reported this event.

This will help you learn what happens beneath the surface.\n\nDisplaying only warning events\nUnlike the kubectl describe command, which only displays events related to the object you’re describing, the kubectl get events command displays all events. This is useful if you want to check if there are events that you should be concerned about. You may want to ignore events of type Normal and focus only on those of type Warning.\nThe API provides a way to filter objects through a mechanism called field selectors. Only objects where the specified field matches the specified selector value are returned. You can use this to display only Warning events. The kubectl get command allows you to specify the field selector with the --field-selector option. To list only events that represent warnings, you execute the following command:\n$ kubectl get ev --field-selector type=Warning\nNo resources found in default namespace.\n\nIf the command does not print any events, as in the above case, no warnings have been recorded in your cluster recently.\nYou may wonder how I knew the exact name of the field to be used in the field selector and what its exact value should be (perhaps it should have been lower case, for example). Hats off if you guessed that this information is provided by the kubectl explain events command. Since events are regular API objects, you can use it to look up documentation on the event objects’ structure. There you’ll learn that the type field can have two values: either Normal or Warning.\nExamining the YAML of the Event object\nTo inspect the events in your cluster, the commands kubectl describe and kubectl get events should be sufficient. Unlike other objects, you’ll probably never have to display the complete YAML of an Event object. But I’d like to take this opportunity to show you an annoying thing about Kubernetes object manifests that the API returns.\nEvent objects have no spec and status sections\nIf you use the kubectl explain to explore the structure of the Event object, you’ll notice that it has no spec or status sections. Unfortunately, this means that its fields are not as nicely organized as in the Node object, for example.\nInspect the following listing and see if you can easily find the object kind, metadata and other fields.\nListing 4.8 The YAML manifest of an Event object\napiVersion: v1\ncount: 1\neventTime: null\nfirstTimestamp: \"2020-05-17T18:16:40Z\"\ninvolvedObject:\n  kind: Node\n  name: kind-worker2\n  uid: kind-worker2\nkind: Event\nlastTimestamp: \"2020-05-17T18:16:40Z\"\nmessage: Starting kubelet.\nmetadata:\n  creationTimestamp: \"2020-05-17T18:16:40Z\"\n  managedFields:\n  - ...\n  name: kind-worker2.160fe38fc0bc3703             #D\n  namespace: default\n  resourceVersion: \"3528471\"\n  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/events/kind-worker2.160f...\n  uid: da97e812-d89e-4890-9663-091fd1ec5e2d\nreason: Starting\nreportingComponent: \"\"\nreportingInstance: \"\"\nsource:\n  component: kubelet\n  host: kind-worker2\ntype: Normal\n\nYou will surely agree that the YAML manifest in the listing is disorganized. The fields are listed alphabetically instead of being organized into coherent groups. This makes it difficult for us humans to read. It looks so chaotic that it’s no wonder that many people hate to deal with Kubernetes YAML or JSON manifests, since both suffer from this problem.\nIn contrast, the earlier YAML manifest of the Node object was relatively easy to read, because the order of the top-level fields is what one would expect: apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec, and status. You’ll notice that this is simply because the alphabetical order of the five fields just happens to make sense. But the fields under those fields suffer from the same problem, as they are also sorted alphabetically.\nYAML is supposed to be easy for people to read, but the alphabetical field order in Kubernetes YAML breaks this. Fortunately, most objects contain the spec and status sections, so at least the top-level fields in these objects are well organized. As for the rest, you’ll just have to accept this unfortunate aspect of dealing with Kubernetes manifests.\n"},"docs/Summary_4.html":{"url":"docs/Summary_4.html","title":"4.4 Summary","keywords":"","body":"Summary\nIn this chapter, you’ve learned:\n\nKubernetes provides a RESTful API for interaction with a cluster. API Objects map to actual components that make up the cluster, including applications, load balancers, nodes, storage volumes, and many others.\nAn object instance can be represented by many resources. A single object type can be exposed through several resources that are just different representations of the same thing.\nKubernetes API objects are described in YAML or JSON manifests. Objects are created by posting a manifest to the API. The status of the object is stored in the object itself and can be retrieved by requesting the object from the API with a GET request.\nAll Kubernetes API objects contain Type and Object Metadata, and most have a spec and status sections. A few object types don’t have these two sections, because they only contain static data.\nControllers bring objects to life by constantly watching for changes in their spec, updating the cluster state and reporting the current state via the object’s status field.\nAs controllers manage Kubernetes API objects, they emit events to reveal what actions they have performed. Like everything else, events are represented by Event objects and can be retrieved through the API. Events signal what is happening to a Node or other object. They show what has recently happened to the object and can provide clues as to why it is broken.\nThe kubectl explain command provides a quick way to look up documentation on a specific object kind and its fields from the command line.\nThe status in a Node object contains information about the node’s IP address and hostname, its resource capacity, conditions, cached container images and other information about the node. Which pods are running on the node is not part of the node’s status, but the kubectl describe node commands gets this information from the pods resource.\nMany object types use status conditions to signal the state of the component that the object represents. For nodes, these conditions are MemoryPressure, DiskPressure and PIDPressure. Each condition is either True, False, or Unknown and has an associated reason and message that explain why the condition is in the specified state.\n\nYou should now be familiar with the general structure of the Kubernetes API objects. In the next chapter, you’ll learn about the Pod object, the fundamental building block which represents one running instance of your application.\n"},"docs/Running_applications_in_Pods.html":{"url":"docs/Running_applications_in_Pods.html","title":"5.

Let’s start with the Pod object, as it represents the central, most important concept in Kubernetes - a running instance of your application.\n"},"docs/Understanding_pods.html":{"url":"docs/Understanding_pods.html","title":"5.1  Understanding pods","keywords":"","body":"Understanding pods\nYou’ve already learned that a pod is a co-located group of containers and the basic building block in Kubernetes. Instead of deploying containers individually, you deploy and manage a group of containers as a single unit — a pod. Although pods may contain several, it’s not uncommon for a pod to contain just a single container. When a pod has multiple containers, all of them run on the same worker node — a single pod instance never spans multiple nodes. Figure 5.2 will help you visualize this information.\nFigure 5.2 All containers of a pod run on the same node. A pod never spans multiple nodes.\n\nUnderstanding why we need pods\nLet’s discuss why we need to run multiple containers together, as opposed to, for example, running multiple processes in the same container.\nUnderstanding why one container shouldn’t contain multiple processes\nImagine an application that consists of several processes that communicate with each other via IPC (Inter-Process Communication) or shared files, which requires them to run on the same computer. In chapter 2, you learned that each container is like an isolated computer or virtual machine. A computer typically runs several processes; containers can also do this. You can run all the processes that make up an application in just one container, but that makes the container very difficult to manage.\nContainers are designed to run only a single process, not counting any child processes that it spawns. Both container tooling and Kubernetes were developed around this fact. For example, a process running in a container is expected to write its logs to standard output. Docker and Kubernetes commands that you use to display the logs only show what has been captured from this output. If a single process is running in the container, it’s the only writer, but if you run multiple processes in the container, they all write to the same output. Their logs are therefore intertwined, and it is difficult to tell which process each logged line belongs to.\nAnother indication that containers should only run a single process is the fact that the container runtime only restarts the container when the container’s root process dies. It doesn’t care about any child processes created by this root process. If it spawns child processes, it alone is responsible for keeping all these processes running.\nTo take full advantage of the features provided by the container runtime, you should consider running only one process in each container.\nUnderstanding how a pod combines multiple containers\nSince you shouldn’t run multiple processes in a single container, it’s evident you need another higher-level construct that allows you to run related processes together even when divided into multiple containers. These processes must be able to communicate with each other like processes in a normal computer. And that is why pods were introduced.\nWith a pod, you can run closely related processes together, giving them (almost) the same environment as if they were all running in a single container. These processes are somewhat isolated, but not completely - they share some resources. This gives you the best of both worlds. You can use all the features that containers offer, but also allow processes to work together. A pod makes these interconnected containers manageable as one unit.\nIn the second chapter, you learned that a container uses its own set of Linux namespaces, but it can also share some with other containers. This sharing of namespaces is exactly how Kubernetes and the container runtime combine containers into pods.\nAs shown in figure 5.3, all containers in a pod share the same Network namespace and thus the network interfaces, IP address(es) and port space that belong to it.\nFigure 5.3 Containers in a pod share the same network interfaces\n\nBecause of the shared port space, processes running in containers of the same pod can’t be bound to the same port numbers, whereas processes in other pods have their own network interfaces and port spaces, eliminating port conflicts between different pods.\nAll the containers in a pod also see the same system hostname, because they share the UTS namespace, and can communicate through the usual IPC mechanisms because they share the IPC namespace. A pod can also be configured to use a single PID namespace for all its containers, which makes them share a single process tree, but you must explicitly enable this for each pod individually.\nNOTE \nWhen containers of the same pod use separate PID namespaces, they can’t see each other or send process signals like SIGTERM or SIGINT between them.\n\nIt’s this sharing of certain namespaces that gives the processes running in a pod the impression that they run together, even though they run in separate containers.\nIt’s this sharing of certain namespaces that gives the processes running in a pod the impression that they run together, even though they run in separate containers.\nIn contrast, each container always has its own Mount namespace, giving it its own file system, but when two containers must share a part of the file system, you can add a volume to the pod and mount it into both containers. The two containers still use two separate Mount namespaces, but the shared volume is mounted into both. You’ll learn more about volumes in chapter 7.\nOrganizing containers into pods\nYou can think of each pod as a separate computer. Unlike virtual machines, which typically host multiple applications, you typically run only one application in each pod. You never need to combine multiple applications in a single pod, as pods have almost no resource overhead. You can have as many pods as you need, so instead of stuffing all your applications into a single pod, you should divide them so that each pod runs only closely related application processes.\nLet me illustrate this with a concrete example.\nSplitting a multi-tier application stack into multiple pods\nImagine a simple system composed of a front-end web server and a back-end database. I’ve already explained that the front-end server and the database shouldn’t run in the same container, as all the features built into containers were designed around the expectation that not more than one process runs in a container. If not in a single container, should you then run them in separate containers that are all in the same pod?\nAlthough nothing prevents you from running both the front-end server and the database in a single pod, this isn’t the best approach. I’ve explained that all containers of a pod always run co-located, but do the web server and the database have to run on the same computer? The answer is obviously no, as they can easily communicate over the network. Therefore you shouldn’t run them in the same pod.\nIf both the front-end and the back-end are in the same pod, both run on the same cluster node. If you have a two-node cluster and only create this one pod, you are using only a single worker node and aren’t taking advantage of the computing resources available on the second node. This means wasted CPU, memory, disk storage and bandwidth. Splitting the containers into two pods allows Kubernetes to place the front-end pod on one node and the back-end pod on the other, thereby improving the utilization of your hardware.\nSplitting into multiple pods to enable individual scaling\nAnother reason not to use a single pod has to do with horizontal scaling. A pod is not only the basic unit of deployment, but also the basic unit of scaling. In chapter 2 you scaled the Deployment object and Kubernetes created additional pods – additional replicas of your application. Kubernetes doesn’t replicate containers within a pod. It replicates the entire pod.\nFront-end components usually have different scaling requirements than back-end components, so we typically scale them individually. When your pod contains both the front-end and back-end containers and Kubernetes replicates it, you end up with multiple instances of both the front-end and back-end containers, which isn’t always what you want. Stateful back-ends, such as databases, usually can’t be scaled. At least not as easily as stateless front ends. If a container has to be scaled separately from the other components, this is a clear indication that it must be deployed in a separate pod.\nThe following figure illustrates what was just explained.\nFigure 5.4 Splitting an application stack into pods\n\nSplitting application stacks into multiple pods is the correct approach. But then, when does one run multiple containers in the same pod?\nIntroducing sidecar containers\nPlacing several containers in a single pod is only appropriate if the application consists of a primary process and one or more processes that complement the operation of the primary process. The container in which the complementary process runs is called a sidecar container because it’s analogous to a motorcycle sidecar, which makes the motorcycle more stable and offers the possibility of carrying an additional passenger. But unlike motorcycles, a pod can have more than one sidecar, as shown in figure 5.5.\nFigure 5.5 A pod with a primary and sidecar container(s)\nIt’s difficult to imagine what constitutes a complementary process, so I’ll give you some examples. In chapter 2, you deployed pods with one container that runs a Node.js application. The Node.js application only supports the HTTP protocol. To make it support HTTPS, we could add a bit more JavaScript code, but we can also do it without changing the existing application at all - by adding an additional container to the pod – a reverse proxy that converts HTTPS traffic to HTTP and forwards it to the Node.js container. The Node.js container is thus the primary container, whereas the container running the proxy is the sidecar container. Figure 5.6 shows this example.\nFigure 5.6 A sidecar container that converts HTTPS traffic to HTTP\n\nNOTE\nYou’ll create this pod in section 5.4.\n\nAnother example, shown in figure 5.7, is a pod where the primary container runs a web server that serves files from its webroot directory. The other container in the pod is an agent that periodically downloads content from an external source and stores it in the web server’s webroot directory. As I mentioned earlier, two containers can share files by sharing a volume. The webroot directory would be located on this volume.\nFigure 5.7 A sidecar container that delivers content to the web server container via a volume\n\nNOTE\nYou’ll create this pod in the chapter 7.\n\nOther examples of sidecar containers are log rotators and collectors, data processors, communication adapters, and others.\nUnlike changing the application’s existing code, adding a sidecar increases the pod’s resources requirements because an additional process must run in the pod. But keep in mind that adding code to legacy applications can be very difficult. This could be because its code is difficult to modify, it’s difficult to set up the build environment, or the source code itself is no longer available. Extending the application by adding an additional process is sometimes a cheaper and faster option.\nHow to decide whether to split containers into multiple pods\nWhen deciding whether to use the sidecar pattern and place containers in a single pod, or to place them in separate pods, ask yourself the following questions:\n\nDo these containers have to run on the same host?\nDo I want to manage them as a single unit?\nDo they form a unified whole instead of being independent components?\nDo they have to be scaled together?\nCan a single node meet their combined resource needs?\n\nIf the answer to all these questions is yes, put them all in the same pod. As a rule of thumb, always place containers in separate pods unless a specific reason requires them to be part of the same pod.\n"},"docs/Creating_pods_from_YAML_or_JSON_files.html":{"url":"docs/Creating_pods_from_YAML_or_JSON_files.html","title":"5.2 Creating pods from YAML or JSON files","keywords":"","body":"Creating pods from YAML or JSON files\nWith the information you learned in the previous sections, you can now start creating pods. In chapter 3, you created them using the imperative command kubectl create, but pods and other Kubernetes objects are usually created by creating a JSON or YAML manifest file and posting it to the Kubernetes API, as you’ve already learned in the previous chapter.\nNOTE\nThe decision whether to use YAML or JSON to define your objects is yours. Most people prefer to use YAML because it’s slightly more human-friendly and allows you to add comments to the object definition.\n\nBy using YAML files to define the structure of your application, you don’t need shell scripts to make the process of deploying your applications repeatable, and you can keep a history of all changes by storing these files in a VCS (Version Control System). Just like you store code.\nIn fact, the application manifests of the exercises in this book are all stored in a VCS. You can find them on GitHub at github.com/luksa/kubernetes-in-action-2ed.\nCreating a YAML manifest for a pod\nIn the previous chapter you learned how to retrieve and examine the YAML manifests of existing API objects. Now you’ll create an object manifest from scratch.\nYou’ll start by creating a file called kubia.yaml on your computer, in a file directory of your choice. You can also find the file in the book’s code archive, available on GitHub. The file is in the Chapter04/ directory. The following listing shows its contents.\nListing 5.1 A basic pod manifest: kubia.yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:    \n  name: kubia\nspec:    \n  containers:     \n  - name: kubia\n    image: luksa/kubia:1.0\n    ports:        \n    - containerPort: 8080\n\nI’m sure you’ll agree that this pod manifest is much easier to understand than the mammoth of a manifest representing the Node object, which you saw in the previous chapter. But once you post this pod object manifest to the API and then read it back, it won’t be much different.\nThe manifest in listing 5.1 is short only because it does not yet contain all the fields that a pod object gets after it is created through the API. For example, you’ll notice that the metadata section contains only a single field and that the status section is completely missing. Once you create the object from this manifest, this will no longer be the case. But we’ll get to that later.\nBefore you create the object, let’s examine the manifest in detail. It uses version v1 of the Kubernetes API to describe the object. The object is a Pod called kubia. The pod consists of a single container called kubia, based on the luksa/kubia:1.0 image. The pod definition also specifies that the application in the container listens on port 8080.\nTIP\nWhenever you want to create a pod manifest from scratch, you can also use the following command to create the file and then edit it to add more fields: kubectl run kubia --image=luksa/kubia:1.0 --dry-run=client -o yaml > mypod.yaml. The --dry-run=client flag tells kubectl to output the definition instead of actually creating the object via the API.\n\nThe fields in the YAML file are self-explanatory, but if you want more information about each field or want to know what additional fields you can add, remember to use the kubectl explain pods command.\nCreating the Pod object from the YAML file\nAfter you’ve prepared the manifest file for your pod, you can now create the object by posting the file to the Kubernetes API.\nCreating objects by applying the manifest file to the cluster\nWhen you post the manifest to the API, you are directing Kubernetes to apply the manifest to the cluster. That’s why the kubectl sub-command that does this is called apply. Let’s use it to create the pod:\n$ kubectl apply -f kubia.yaml\npod “kubia” created\n\nUpdating objects by modifying the manifest file and re-applying it\nThe kubectl apply command is used for creating objects as well as for making changes to existing objects. If you later decide to make changes to your pod object, you can simply edit the kubia.yaml file and run the apply command again. Some of the pod’s fields aren’t mutable, so the update may fail, but you can always delete the pod and then create it again. You’ll learn how to delete pods and other objects at the end of this chapter.\nRetrieving the full manifest of a running pod\nThe pod object is now part of the cluster configuration. You can now read it back from the API to see the full object manifest with the following command:\n$ kubectl get po kubia -o yaml\n\nIf you run this command, you’ll notice that the manifest has grown considerably compared to the one in the kubia.yaml file. You’ll see that the metadata section is now much bigger, and the object now has a status section. The spec section has also grown by several fields. You can use kubectl explain to learn more about these new fields, but most of them will be explained in this and the following chapters.\nChecking the newly created pod\nLet’s use the basic kubectl commands to see how the pod is doing before we start interacting with the application running inside it.\nQuickly checking the status of a pod\nYour Pod object has been created, but how do you know if the container in the pod is actually running? You can use the kubectl get command to see a summary of the pod:\n$ kubectl get pod kubia\nNAME     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nkubia    1/1     Running   0          32s\n\nYou can see that the pod is running, but not much else. To see more, you can try the kubectl get pod -o wide or the kubectl describe command that you learned in the previous chapter.\nUsing kubectl describe to see pod details\nTo display a more detailed view of the pod, use the kubectl describe command:\nListing 5.2 Using kubectl describe pod to inspect a pod\n$ kubectl describe pod kubia\nName:         kubia\nNamespace:    default\nPriority:     0\nNode:         worker2/172.18.0.4\nStart Time:   Mon, 27 Jan 2020 12:53:28 +0100\n...\n\nThe listing doesn’t show the entire output, but if you run the command yourself, you’ll see virtually all information that you’d see if you print the complete object manifest using the kubectl get -o yaml command.\nInspecting events to see what happens beneath the surface\nAs in the previous chapter where you used the describe node command to inspect a Node object, the describe pod command should display several events related to the pod at the bottom of the output.\nIf you remember, these events aren’t part of the object itself, but are separate objects. Let’s print them to learn more about what happens when you create the pod object. The following listing shows all the events that were logged after creating the pod.\nListing 5.3 Events recorded after deploying a Pod object\n$ kubectl get events\nLAST SEEN   TYPE     REASON      OBJECT      MESSAGE\n   Normal   Scheduled   pod/kubia   Successfully assigned default/\n                                             kubia to worker2\n5m          Normal   Pulling     pod/kubia   Pulling image luksa/kubia:1.0\n5m          Normal   Pulled      pod/kubia   Successfully pulled image\n5m          Normal   Created     pod/kubia   Created container kubia\n5m          Normal   Started     pod/kubia   Started container kubia\n\nThese events are printed in chronological order. The most recent event is at the bottom. You see that the pod was first assigned to one of the worker nodes, then the container image was pulled, then the container was created and finally started.\nNo warning events are displayed, so everything seems to be fine. If this is not the case in your cluster, you should read section 5.4 to learn how to troubleshoot pod failures.\n"},"docs/Interacting_with_the_application_and_the_pod.html":{"url":"docs/Interacting_with_the_application_and_the_pod.html","title":"5.3 Interacting with the application and the pod","keywords":"","body":"Interacting with the application and the pod\nYour container is now running. In this section, you’ll learn how to communicate with the application, inspect its logs, and execute commands in the container to explore the application’s environment. Let’s confirm that the application running in the container responds to your requests.\nSending requests to the application in the pod\nIn chapter 2, you used the kubectl expose command to create a service that provisioned a load balancer so you could talk to the application running in your pod(s). You’ll now take a different approach. For development, testing and debugging purposes, you may want to communicate directly with a specific pod, rather than using a service that forwards connections to randomly selected pods.\nYou’ve learned that each pod is assigned its own IP address where it can be accessed by every other pod in the cluster. This IP address is typically internal to the cluster. You can’t access it from your local computer, except when Kubernetes is deployed in a specific way – for example, when using kind or Minikube without a VM to create the cluster.\nIn general, to access pods, you must use one of the methods described in the following sections. First, let’s determine the pod’s IP address.\nGetting the pod’s IP address\nYou can get the pod’s IP address by retrieving the pod’s full YAML and searching for the podIP field in the status section. Alternatively, you can display the IP with kubectl describe, but the easiest way is to use kubectl get with the wide output option:\n$ kubectl get pod kubia -o wide\nNAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP           NODE     ...\nkubia   1/1     Running   0          35m   10.244.2.4   worker2  ...\n\nAs indicated in the IP column, my pod’s IP is 10.244.2.4. Now I need to determine the port number the application is listening on.\nGetting the port the application is bound to\nIf I wasn’t the author of the application, it would be difficult for me to find out which port the application listens on. I could inspect its source code or the Dockerfile of the container image, as the port is usually specified there, but I might not have access to either. If someone else had created the pod, how would I know which port it was listening on?\nFortunately, you can specify a list of ports in the pod definition itself. It isn’t necessary to specify any ports, but it is a good idea to always do so. See sidebar for details.\nWhy specify container ports in pod definitions\nSpecifying ports in the pod definition is purely informative. Their omission has no effect on whether clients can connect to the pod’s port. If the container accepts connections through a port bound to its IP address, anyone can connect to it, even if the port isn’t explicitly specified in the pod spec or if you specify an incorrect port number.\nDespite this, it’s a good idea to always specify the ports so that anyone who has access to your cluster can see which ports each pod exposes. By explicitly defining ports, you can also assign a name to each port, which is very useful when you expose pods via services.\nThe pod manifest says that the container uses port 8080, so you now have everything you need to talk to the application.\nConnecting to the pod from the worker nodes\nThe Kubernetes network model dictates that each pod is accessible from any other pod and that each node can reach any pod on any node in the cluster.\nBecause of this, one way to communicate with your pod is to log into one of your worker nodes and talk to the pod from there. You’ve already learned that the way you log on to a node depends on what you used to deploy your cluster. In Minikube, you can run minikube ssh to log in to your single node. On GKE use the gcloud compute ssh command. For other clusters refer to their documentation.\nOnce you have logged into the node, use the curl command with the pod’s IP and port to access your application. My pod’s IP is 10.244.2.4 and the port is 8080, so I run the following command:\n$ curl 10.244.2.4:8080\nHey there, this is kubia. Your IP is ::ffff:10.244.2.1.\n\nNormally you don’t use this method to talk to your pods, but you may need to use it if there are communication issues and you want to find the cause by first trying the shortest possible communication route. In this case, it’s best to log into the node where the pod is located and run curl from there. The communication between it and the pod takes place locally, so this method always has the highest chances of success.\nConnecting from a one-off client pod\nThe second way to test the connectivity of your application is to run curl in another pod that you create specifically for this task. Use this method to test if other pods will be able to access your pod. Even if the network works perfectly, this may not be the case. In chapter 24, you’ll learn how to lock down the network by isolating pods from each other. In such a system, a pod can only talk to the pods it’s allowed to.\nTo run curl in a one-off pod, use the following command:\n$ kubectl run --image=tutum/curl -it --restart=Never --rm client-pod curl 10.244.2.4:8080\nHey there, this is kubia. Your IP is ::ffff:10.244.2.5.\npod \"client-pod\" deleted\n\nThis command runs a pod with a single container created from the tutum/curl image. You can also use any other image that provides the curl binary executable. The -it option attaches your console to the container’s standard input and output, the --restart=Never option ensures that the pod is considered Completed when the curl command and its container terminate, and the --rm options removes the pod at the end. The name of the pod is client-pod and the command executed in its container is curl 10.244.2.4:8080.\nNOTE\nYou can also modify the command to run the bash shell in the client pod and then run curl from the shell.\n\nCreating a pod just to see if it can access another pod is useful when you’re specifically testing pod-to-pod connectivity. If you only want to know if your pod is responding to requests, you can also use the method explained in the next section.\nConnecting to pods via kubectl port forwarding\nDuring development, the easiest way to talk to applications running in your pods is to use the kubectl port-forward command, which allows you to communicate with a specific pod through a proxy bound to a network port on your local computer, as shown in the next figure.\nFigure 5.8 Connecting to a pod through the kubectl port-forward proxy\n\nTo open a communication path with a pod, you don’t even need to look up the pod’s IP, as you only need to specify its name and the port. The following command starts a proxy that forwards your computer’s local port 8080 to the kubia pod’s port 8080:\n$ kubectl port-forward kubia 8080\n... Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080\n... Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 8080\n\nThe proxy now waits for incoming connections. Run the following curl command in another terminal:\n$ curl localhost:8080\nHey there, this is kubia. Your IP is ::ffff:127.0.0.1.\n\nAs you can see, curl has connected to the local proxy and received the response from the pod. While the port-forward command is the easiest method for communicating with a specific pod during development and troubleshooting, it’s also the most complex method in terms of what happens underneath. Communication passes through several components, so if anything is broken in the communication path, you won’t be able to talk to the pod, even if the pod itself is accessible via regular communication channels.\nNOTE\nThe kubectl port-forward command can also forward connections to services instead of pods and has several other useful features. Run kubectl port-forward --help to learn more.\n\nFigure 5.9 shows how the network packets flow from the curl process to your application and back.\nFigure 5.9 The long communication path between curl and the container when using port forwarding\n\nAs shown in the figure, the curl process connects to the proxy, which connects to the API server, which then connects to the Kubelet on the node that hosts the pod, and the Kubelet then connects to the container through the pod’s loopback device (in other words, through the localhost address). I’m sure you’ll agree that the communication path is exceptionally long.\nNOTE\nThe application in the container must be bound to a port on the loopback device for the Kubelet to reach it. If it listens only on the pod’s eth0 network interface, you won’t be able to reach it with the kubectl port-forward command.\n\nViewing application logs\nYour Node.js application writes its log to the standard output stream. Instead of writing the log to a file, containerized applications usually log to the standard output (stdout) and standard error streams (stderr). This allows the container runtime to intercept the output, store it in a consistent location (usually /var/log/containers) and provide access to the log without having to know where each application stores its log files.\nWhen you run an application in a container using Docker, you can display its log with docker logs . When you run your application in Kubernetes, you could log into the node that hosts the pod and display its log using docker logs, but Kubernetes provides an easier way to do this with the kubectl logs command.\nRetrieving a pod’s log with kubectl logs\nTo view the log of your pod (more specifically, the container’s log), run the command shown in the following listing on your local computer:\nListing 5.4 Displaying a pod’s log\n$ kubectl logs kubia\nKubia server starting...\nLocal hostname is kubia\nListening on port 8080\nReceived request for / from ::ffff:10.244.2.1\nReceived request for / from ::ffff:10.244.2.5\nReceived request for / from ::ffff:127.0.0.1\n\nStreaming logs using kubectl logs -f\nIf you want to stream the application log in real-time to see each request as it comes in, you can run the command with the --follow option (or the shorter version -f):\n$ kubectl logs kubia -f\n\nNow send some additional requests to the application and have a look at the log. Press ctrl-C to stop streaming the log when you’re done.\nDisplaying the timestamp of each logged line\nYou may have noticed that we forgot to include the timestamp in the log statement. Logs without timestamps have limited usability. Fortunately, the container runtime attaches the current timestamp to every line produced by the application. You can display these timestamps by using the --timestamps=true option, as shown in the next listing.\nListing 5.5 Displaying the timestamp of each log line\n$ kubectl logs kubia –-timestamps=true\n2020-02-01T09:44:40.954641934Z Kubia server starting...\n2020-02-01T09:44:40.955123432Z Local hostname is kubia\n2020-02-01T09:44:40.956435431Z Listening on port 8080\n2020-02-01T09:50:04.978043089Z Received request for / from ...\n2020-02-01T09:50:33.640897378Z Received request for / from ...\n2020-02-01T09:50:44.781473256Z Received request for / from ...\n\nTIP\nYou can display timestamps by only typing --timestamps without the value. For boolean options, merely specifying the option name sets the option to true. This applies to all kubectl options that take a Boolean value and default to false.\n\nDisplaying recent logs\nThe previous feature is great if you run third-party applications that don’t include the timestamp in their log output, but the fact that each line is timestamped brings us another benefit: filtering log lines by time. Kubectl provides two ways of filtering the logs by time.\nThe first option is when you want to only display logs from the past several seconds, minutes or hours. For example, to see the logs produced in the last two minutes, run:\n$ kubectl logs kubia --since=2m\n\nThe other option is to display logs produced after a specific date and time using the --since-time option. The time format to be used is RFC3339. For example, the following command is used to print logs produced after February 1st, 2020 at 9:50 a.m.:\n$ kubectl logs kubia –-since-time=2020-02-01T09:50:00Z\n\nDisplaying the last several lines of the log\nInstead of using time to constrain the output, you can also specify how many lines from the end of the log you want to display. To display the last ten lines, try:\n$ kubectl logs kubia –-tail=10\n\nNOTE\nKubectl options that take a value can be specified with an equal sign or with a space. Instead of --tail=10, you can also type --tail 10.\n\nUnderstanding the availability of the pod’s logs\nKubernetes keeps a separate log file for each container. They are usually stored in /var/log/containers on the node that runs the container. A separate file is created for each container. If the container is restarted, its logs are written to a new file. Because of this, if the container is restarted while you’re following its log with kubectl logs -f, the command will terminate, and you’ll need to run it again to stream the new container’s logs.\nThe kubectl logs command displays only the logs of the current container. To view the logs from the previous container, use the --previous (or -p) option.\nNOTE\nDepending on your cluster configuration, the log files may also be rotated when they reach a certain size. In this case, kubectl logs will only display the new log file. When streaming the logs, you must restart the command to switch to the new file.\n\nWhen you delete a pod, all its log files are also deleted. To make pods’ logs available permanently, you need to set up a central, cluster-wide logging system. Chapter 23 explains how.\nWhat about applications that write their logs to files?\nIf your application writes its logs to a file instead of stdout, you may be wondering how to access that file. Ideally, you’d configure the centralized logging system to collect the logs so you can view them in a central location, but sometimes you just want to keep things simple and don’t mind accessing the logs manually. In the next two sections, you’ll learn how to copy log and other files from the container to your computer and in the opposite direction, and how to run commands in running containers. You can use either method to display the log files or any other file inside the container.\nCopying files to and from containers\nSometimes you may want to add a file to a running container or retrieve a file from it. Modifying files in running containers isn’t something you normally do - at least not in production - but it can be useful during development.\nKubectl offers the cp command to copy files or directories from your local computer to a container of any pod or from the container to your computer. For example, to copy the /etc/hosts file from the container of the kubia pod to the /tmp directory on your local file system, run the following command:\n$ kubectl cp kubia:/etc/hosts /tmp/kubia-hosts\n\nTo copy a file from your local file system to the container, run the following command:\n$ kubectl cp /path/to/local/file kubia:path/in/container\n\nNOTE\n///////TODO\n\n5.3.4   Executing commands in running containers\n"},"docs/Running_multiple_containers_in_a_pod.html":{"url":"docs/Running_multiple_containers_in_a_pod.html","title":"5.4 Running multiple containers in a pod","keywords":"","body":""},"docs/Running_additional_containers_at_pod_startup.html":{"url":"docs/Running_additional_containers_at_pod_startup.html","title":"5.5 Running additional containers at pod startup","keywords":"","body":""},"docs/Deleting_pods_and_other_objects.html":{"url":"docs/Deleting_pods_and_other_objects.html","title":"5.6 Deleting pods and other objects","keywords":"","body":""},"docs/Summary_5.html":{"url":"docs/Summary_5.html","title":"5.7 Summary","keywords":"","body":"Summary\nIn this chapter, you’ve learned:\n\nPods run one or more containers as a co-located group. They are the unit of deployment and horizontal scaling. A typical container runs only one process. Sidecar containers complement the primary container in the pod.\nContainers should only be part of the same pod if they must run together. A frontend and a backend process should run in separate pods. This allows them to be scaled individually.\nWhen a pod starts, its init containers run one after the other. When the last init container completes, the pod’s main containers are started. You can use an init container to configure the pod from within, delay startup of its main containers until a precondition is met, or notify an external service that the pod is about to start running.\nThe kubectl tool is used to create pods, view their logs, copy files to/from their containers, execute commands in those containers and enable communication with individual pods during development.\n\nIn the next chapter, you’ll learn about the lifecycle of the pod and its containers.\n"}}}
